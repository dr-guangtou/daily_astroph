- [Milky Way Satellite Census. III. Constraints on Dark Matter Properties from Observations of Milky Way Satellite Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00022)
    - Our results are consistent with the cold, collisionless DM paradigm and yield the strongest cosmological constraints to date on particle models of warm, interacting, and fuzzy dark matter.

- [Standard candles and sirens rescue H0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00869)
    - 用双中子星并合电磁波对应体观测和SNIa观测联合限制宇宙学：The luminosity distance inferred from these probes and its scatter depend on the underlying cosmology. By using the gravitatonal lensing of light or gravitational waves emitted by, and peculiar motion of, these systems we derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, the equation of state of dark energy parametrised in the form w0+wa(1−a), along with the Hubble constant and cold dark matter density in the Universe

- [Fast radio bursts to be detected with the Square Kilometre Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00007)
    - The occurrence rates of non-repeating and repeating FRBs could be controlled by the cosmic stellar-mass density (CSMD) and star formation-rate density (CSFRD), respectively.
    - 分别给出SKA观测的预测：At z≳2, z≳6 and z≳10, non-repeating FRBs will be detected with the SKA at a rate of ∼104, ∼102, and ∼10 (sky−1 day−1), respectively, if their luminosity function follows the CSMD evolution. At z≳1, z≳2, and z≳4, sources of repeating FRBs will be detected at a rate of ∼103, ∼102, and ≲10 (sky−1 day−1), respectively, assuming that the redshift evolution of their luminosity function is scaled with the CSFRD.

- [Quenched fractions in the IllustrisTNG simulations: comparison with observations and other theoretical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00004)
    - **Relevant**
    - TNG300: The definition used to separate quenched and star-forming galaxies produces differences of up to 70 (30)% for centrals (satellites) >∼10^10.5M⊙ 增大计算SFR的孔径可以压低quenched fraction
    - Taking projected rather than 3D distances for satellites decreases the quenched fractions by up to 10% due to field contamination. 考虑各种因素后，TNG和观测符合得可以

- [Quenched fractions in the IllustrisTNG simulations: comparison with observations and other theoretical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00004)
    - **Relevant**
    - TNG predicts a quenched fraction of ∼70−90% (on average) for centrals and satellites ≳10^10.5M⊙, regardless of host mass, cosmic time (0≤z≤0.5), clustercentric distance and time since infall in the z=0
    - The fraction of low-mass passive galaxies is higher closer to the host center and for more massive hosts.
    - In fact, ∼30% of group and cluster satellites that are quenched at z=0 were already quenched before falling into their current host, and the bulk of them quenched as early as 4 to 10 billion years ago.

- [SMASHing the low surface brightness SMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00012)
    - SMC的很深的CMD研究：Special care was taken in the decontamination of our data from MW foreground stars, including from foreground globular clusters NGC 362 and 47 Tuc.
    - 重构SBF以及stellar density分布：This approach, based on stellar counts of the oldest main sequence turn-off (MSTO) stars, uncovered a tidally disrupted stellar feature that reaches as far out as 12 degrees from the SMC centre. We also serendipitously found a faint feature of unknown origin located at ∼14 degrees from the centre of the SMC and that we tentatively associated to a more distant structure.

- [MEGARA-IFU detection of extended HeII4686 nebular emission in the central region of NGC1569 and its ionization budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00320)
    - GTC观测：the detection of extended HeII4686 nebular emission in the central region of NGC1569
    - We infer 124+/-11 Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in SSC-A using the HeII4686 broad feature and Av=2.3 mag. 这些WR星的电离可以解释HeII线

- [SPT-CL J2032-5627: a new Southern double relic cluster observed with ASKAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00660)
    - ASKAP观测 943 MHz shows two previously undetected radio relics at either side of the cluster； both have steep integrated radio spectra (αSE=−1.33±0.10 and αNW,full=−1.16±0.12
    - These low-power radio relics will become more prevalent in upcoming large-area radio surveys such as the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU).

### Aug 4

- [Characterizing galaxy clusters by their gravitational potential: systematics of cluster potential reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01107)
    - **Relevant**
    - We aim to demonstrate that the systematics associated with cluster gravitational potentials are smaller than the hydrostatic mass bias and that cluster potentials could therefore be a good alternative to cluster masses in cosmological studies.
    - 用模拟验证：We find that the bias in the reconstructed potential (6%) is less than that of the HE mass (13%), and that the scatter in the reconstructed potential decreases by about 35% with respect to that in the HE mass.

- [Galaxy-group (halo) alignments from SDSS DR7 and the ELUCID simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01381)
    - In observation, the major axes of galaxies are found to be preferentially aligned to the major axes of their host groups. 颜色红的central的alignment更强
    - We also find that central galaxies have their major axes to be aligned to the major axes of their corresponding subhalos in the ELUCID simulation 质量越大的halo里信号越强

- [Hot gaseous atmospheres of rotating galaxies observed with XMM-Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01161)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    - 看旋转占主导的早型星系的X-ray辐射 We present an analysis of the hot atmospheres of six lenticulars and a spiral galaxy to study the effects of angular momentum on the hot gas properties
    - We find an alignment between the hot gas and the stellar distribution, with the ellipticity of the X-ray emission generally lower than that of the optical stellar emission
    - The entropy profiles of NGC 4382 and the massive spiral galaxy NGC 1961 are significantly shallower than the entropy distribution in other galaxies, suggesting the presence of strong heating (via outflows or compressional) in the central regions of these systems

- [CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING). X. Physical conditions of molecular gas and the local SFR-Mass relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01287)
    - 近邻SFMS星系的Nobeyama CO探测：We find that (1) ratio of 12CO to 13CO lines (R1213) positively correlates to specific star-formation rate (sSFR) with a correlation coefficient of 0.46
    - Our results support the scenario where R1213 variation is mainly caused by the changes in molecular-gas properties such as temperature and turbulence

- [Dynamical state for 964 galaxy clusters from Chandra X-ray images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01299)
    - **Relevant**
    - 多种方式描述X-ray形态和星系团动力学状态：Three widely used indicators for dynamical state, the concentration index c, the centroid shift omega and the power ratio P3/P0 are calculated in the circular central region with a radius of 500 kpc.
    - For a large sample of clusters, the dynamical parameters are continuously distributed from the disturbed to relaxed states with a peak in the between, rather than the bimodal distribution for the two states.
    - The offset between masses estimated from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and X-ray images depends on dynamical parameters.

- [LESSER: A Catalogue of Spectroscopically selected sample of Lyman-α Emitters Lensed By Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01361)
    - Search for lensed LAEs in eBOSS: The final catalog contains 361 candidate lensing systems.
    - 0.4 < z < 0.8的LRG作为lens: Among our lensed LAE candidates, 281 systems present single-peaked line profiles while 80 systems show double-peaked features.

- [The halo of M105 and its group environment as traced by planetary nebula populations: I. Wide-field photometric survey of planetary nebulae in the Leo I group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01696)
    - **Relevant**
    - We use PNe as discrete stellar tracers of the diffuse light around M105: We identify 226 PNe candidates within a limiting magnitude of mlim = 28.1 from our Subaru-SuprimeCam imaging, covering 67.6 kpc along the major axis of M105 and the halos of NGC 3384 and NGC 3398.
    - We find an excess of PNe at large radii compared to the stellar surface brightness profile from broad-band surveys: We infer that the radial variation of the PN population properties is due to a diffuse population of metal-poor stars ([M/H] < -1.0) following an exponential profile, in addition to the M105 halo.

### Aug 5

- [Revealing the Local Cosmic Web by Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01738)
    - Here we show that we can reconstruct the Cosmic Web from the galaxy distribution using the convolutional-neural-network based deep-learning algorithm.
    - 在TNG上学习的模型可以重现Eagle的结果；然后应用到Cosmicflow-3上

- [Deconstructing the Planck TT Power Spectrum to Constrain Deviations from ΛCDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01785)
    - we modify the CLASS Boltzmann code to create phenomenological amplitudes, similar to the lensing amplitude parameter AL, for the Sachs-Wolfe, Doppler, early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (eISW), and Polarization contributions to the CMB temperature anisotropy, and then we include these additional amplitudes in fits to the Planck TT power spectrum.
    - 单独考虑每个都不能产生改变，each of these physical effects are being correctly accounted for given the current level of precision.
    - We test adding our phenomenological amplitudes as well as Neff, YHe, and nrun to LCDM + AL and find that none of these model extensions provide significant improvement over LCDM + AL when fitting Planck temperature data.

- [The Halo Spin Transition as a Probe of Dark Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02121)
    - Mass-dependent transitions of the halo spin orientations from the intermediate to the minor principal directions of the local tidal fields can in principle be a useful discriminator of dark energy models.
    - 看在不同的DE模型下，spin transition zone对应的halo质量如何变化
    - Noting that a narrower spin transition zone is more powerful as a probe of dark energy, we also show that the spin transition zones become narrower at higher redshifts, in the filamentary environments and for the case that the tidal fields are smoothed on the smaller scales.
    - Spin transition zone对应的质量区间反应的是潮汐场的非线性演化的速度

- [SUPER-II: Spatially resolved ionized gas kinematics and scaling relations in z~2 AGN host galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01728)
    - SINFONI观测21个Type-I AGN: We detect outflows in all the Type-1 AGN sample based on the w80 value from the integrated spectrum, which is in the range 650-2700 km/s.
    - [OIII] emission is spatially resolved for ∼35% of the Type-1 sample and the outflows show an extension up to ∼6 kpc.
    - The relation between maximum velocity and the bolometric luminosity is consistent with model predictions for shocks from an AGN driven outflow.
    - The escape fraction of the outflowing gas increase with the AGN luminosity, although for most galaxies, this fraction is less than 10%.

- [The nature of CR7 revealed with MUSE: a young starburst powering extended Lyman-α emission at z=6.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01731)
    - MUSE观测这个有多成分的明亮高红移LAE：We measure extended emission with a similar halo scale length as typical LAEs at z≈5. CR7's Lyα halo is clearly elongated along the direction connecting the multiple components, likely tracing the underlying gas distribution.
    - the MUSE data show that the rest-frame Lyα equivalent width (EW) is ≈100 {\AA}. This is a factor four higher than the EW measured in low-redshift analogues with carefully matched Lyα profiles 但可以用SF解释
    - 大部分的Lya发射都来自最亮的UV成分
    - 不需要AGN来解释：CR7's Lyα emission, while extremely luminous, resembles the emission in more common LAEs at lower redshifts very well and is likely powered by a young metal poor starburst.

- [Statistical correlation between the distribution of Lyα emitters and IGM HI at z∼2.2 mapped by Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01733)
    - 看z=2.2处很强的Lya吸收处附近的星系分布：Combining the sample with the Lyα absorption estimated from 64 (e)BOSS quasar spectra, we find a moderate to strong correlation between the LAE overdensity δLAE and the effective optical depth τLoS in line-of-sights
    - The cross-correlation analysis also clearly suggests that up to 4±1 pMpc, LAEs tend to cluster in the regions rich in HI gas, indicated by the high τLoS
    - we find a 30% excess signal at 2σ level at d<200 pkpc, indicating the dense HI in circumgalactic medium, and a tentative excess at 400< d <600 pkpc in IGM regime

- [Substructure in the Globular Cluster Populations of the Virgo Cluster Elliptical Galaxies M84 and M86](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01737)
    - **Relevant**
    - M84/86附近找GC子结构：a peak in the projected number density of globular clusters in M86 that is offset from the system center and may be at least partly due to the presence of the dwarf elliptical galaxy NGC 4406B; a bridge that connects the M84 and M86 globular cluster systems; and a boxy iso-density contour along the southeast side of the M86 globular cluster system.
    - 子结构中主要是blue GC population

- [A SOFIA Survey of [CII] in the galaxy M51 II. [CII] and CO kinematics across spiral arms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01745)
    - Our data show strong velocity gradients in HI, 12CO, and [CII] at the locations of stellar arms (traced by K--band data) with a clear offset in position-velocity space between upstream molecular gas (traced by 12CO) and downstream star formation (traced by [CII]).
    - Our observations, based on the observed velocity gradients and associated offset between CO and [CII], are consistent with the presence of shocks in spiral arms in the inner parts of M51 and in the arm connecting the companion galaxy, M51b, in the outer parts of M51.

- [Arepo-MCRT: Monte Carlo Radiation Hydrodynamics on a Moving Mesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01750)

- [The Next Generation X-ray Galaxy Survey with eROSITA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01870)
    - eROSITA will contribute significantly to X-ray studies of normal (i.e., not AGN) galaxies.
    - Starting from multi-wavelength catalogues, we measure star formation rates and stellar masses for 60 212 galaxies constrained to distances of 50-200 Mpc. 结合X-ray scaling relation以及eROSITA仪器特性，预测XRB和弥散气体的X-ray光度
    - We predict that the eROSITA 4-year survey, will detect ≳ 15 000 galaxies (3 σ significance) at 50-200 Mpc, which is ~100X more normal galaxies than detected in any X-ray survey to date.

- [A large-scale, regular intergalactic magnetic field associated with Stephan's Quintet?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01881)
    - WSRT的Rotation Measure Synthesis观测：We recognise the signature of a large-scale, genuinely regular, magnetised screen, seemingly constrained to the Quintet itself.
    - If indeed associated with the galaxy group in question, it would span a volume of at least 60×40×20kpc and have a strength at least as high as that previously detected within large spiral galaxies. 但仍不能完全排除来自银河系

- [Is extended hard X-ray emission ubiquitous in Compton-thick AGN?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02175)

    - We present the spatial analysis results of a pilot Chandra imaging survey of 7 nearby (0.006< z<0.013) CT AGN: 5/7都有延展硬X-ray发射
    - ESO 137-G034 and NGC 3281 display biconical ionization structures with extended hard X-ray emission reaching kpc-scales (∼ 1.9 kpc and 3.5 kpc in diameter).

- [Inverted metallicity gradients in two Virgo star-forming dwarfs: evidence of recent merging?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02212)
    - 气态丰度测量：The galaxies show positive gas metallicity gradients, contrarily to what is usually found in other dwarfs or in spiral galaxies. We measure gradient slopes of 0.20 ± 0.06 and 0.15 ± 0.03 dex/Re for VCC135 and VCC324
    - The presence of weak underlying substructures in both galaxies and the analysis of morphological diagnostics and of ionised gas kinematics suggest that the inflow of metal-poor gas to the central regions of the dwarfs may be related to a recent merging event with a gas-rich companion.

### Aug 6

- [Artificial intelligence and quasar absorption system modelling; application to fundamental constants at high redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02583)
    - 针对HIRES和ESPRESSO的基于AI的分析工具：The new method forms a sophisticated parallelised system, eliminating human decision-making and hence bias
    - The results show that modelling line broadening for high-redshift absorption components should include both thermal and turbulent components.

- [Exploring reionisation and high-z galaxy observables with recent multi-redshift MWA upper limits on the 21-cm signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02639)
    - We use the latest multi-redshift (z=6.5−8.7) upper limits on the 21-cm signal from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to explore astrophysical models which are inconsistent with the data.
    - We find the vast majority of models disfavoured by the MWA limits are already inconsistent with existing observational constraints. These inconsistent models arise from two classes of models: (i) `cold' reionisation and (ii) pure matter density fluctuations (i.e. no reionisation).

- [Probing the Milky Way's Dark Matter Halo for the 3.5 keV Line](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02283)
    - A comprehensive search for the 3.5 keV line, using ∼51 Ms of archival Chandra observations peering through the Milky Way's Dark Matter Halo from across the entirety of the sky.
    - A non-detection is reported in the total data set, allowing us to set an upper-limit on 3.5 keV line flux and constrain the sterile neutrino dark matter mixing angle.
    - Non-detections are reported in all radial data subsets, allowing us to constrain the spatial profile of 3.5 keV line intensity, which does not conclusively differ from Navarro-Frenk-White predictions.

- [REQUIEM-2D: Spatially Resolved Stellar Populations from HST 2D Grism Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02276)
    - **Interesting, CSST**

    - A significant correlation is found between the X-ray–to–optical power-law slope parameter (αOX) and the 2500 ˚A monochromatic luminosity
    - We demonstrate the existence of a population of non-BAL X-ray weak quasars, and the fractions of quasars that are X-ray weak by factors of ≥ 6 and ≥ 10 are 5.8 ± 0.7% and 2.7 ± 0.5%, respectively

- [The MOSDEF-LRIS Survey: The Connection Between Massive Stars and Ionized Gas in Individual Galaxies at z∼2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02277)
    - BPASS+Cloudy拟合z=2.3的rest-UV spectra
    - Our high-SNR subsample is characterized by a median ionization parameter and oxygen abundance, respectively, of log(U)med=−2.98±0.25 and 12+log(O/H)med=8.48±0.11.
    - Accordingly, we find that all galaxies in our sample show evidence for α-enhancement.
    - We find that the local relationship between ionization parameter and metallicity applies at z∼2.
    - The ubiquity of α-enhancement among z∼2.3 star-forming galaxies indicates important differences between high-redshift and local galaxies that must be accounted for in order to derive physical properties at high redshift.

- [Baryons Shaping Dark Matter Haloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02404)
    - **Relevant**
    - Fenix和Eagle模拟中的DM halo的DMO和Hydro-run比较
    - Our results indicate that baryons have a significant impact on the shape of the inner halo, mainly within ∼ 20 percent of the virial radius. 在有重子过程的时候，halo变得更spherical
    - Our findings also indicate that disc galaxies preferentially form in haloes whose DMo counterparts were originally more spherical and with stronger velocity anisotropy

- [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: A Range in S0 Properties Indicating Multiple Formation Pathways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02426)
    - **Relevant**
    - A simulated merger pathway involving a compact elliptical and gas-rich satellite results in an S0 that lies within the pressure-supported group. We conclude that two S0 formation pathways are active, with mergers dominating in isolated galaxies and smal groups, and the faded spiral pathway being most prominent in large groups (10^13 < Mhalo < 10^14).

- [The turbulent gas structure in the centers of NGC253 and the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02518)

- [A Wide-area GMRT 610~MHz survey of ELAIS N1 field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02530)
    - The primary goal of the survey was to study the polarised sky at sub-mJy flux densities at < GHz frequencies.

    - 新的统计测量：the probability distribution function (PDF) of relative velocity between two different dark matter halos (i.e. pairwise velocity)
    - We demonstrate that our model of the pairwise velocity PDF provides an accurate mapping of the two-point clustering of massive-galaxy-sized halos at the scales of O(10)h−1Mpc between redshift and real space for a given real-space correlation function.
    - Our model of the pairwise velocity PDF will give a detailed explanation of statistics of massive galaxies at the intermediate scales in redshift surveys, including the non-linear redshift-space distortion effect in two-point correlation functions and the measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.

- [The mass function dependence on dark matter haloes dynamical state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03179)
    - **Relevant**
    - 基于MultiDark模拟：We measure the mean relations of concentration, offset and spin as a function of halo mass and redshift and their distributions
    - Halo concentration在大质量端升高；The concentration of low mass haloes shows a faster redshift evolution, especially in the high concentration regime.
    - The offset parameter is smaller at low redshift, in agreement with the relaxation of structures at recent times.
    - 给出一个能预测不同Spin和offset下HMF的模型：This model allows to marginalize over the cool-core bias while constraining cosmological parameters with X-ray selected clusters.

- [Quenching timescales of dwarf satellites around Milky Way-mass hosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02805)
    - DC Justice League模拟里看dwarf satellites的quenched fraction：能够重现比较高的quenched fraction
    - We then trace the histories of satellite galaxies back to z∼15, and find that many satellites with M∗∼10^6−8 solar masses quench within 2 Gyr of infall into the host halo, while others in the same mass range remain star-forming for as long as 5 Gyr.
    - We show that this scatter can be explained by the satellite's gas mass and the ram pressure it feels at infall.
    - 10^8 Msun是一个特征质量，比这个质量更低的卫星的quenching的速度很快

- [Color gradients along the quiescent galaxy sequence: clues to quenching and structural growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02817)
    - **Relevant**
    - CANDELS中的quiescent星系：the youngest quiescent galaxies are not significantly smaller than older quiescent galaxies at fixed stellar mass.
    - These `post-starburst' galaxies only appear smaller in half-light radii because they have systematically flatter color gradients.
    - 年龄和颜色梯度有相关：越老的星系的color gradient越negative
    - We find that the central mass surface density Σ1 is independent of age at fixed stellar mass, and only weakly depends on redshift. 中心区域的质量基本不变化
    - We find that older quiescent galaxies have additional mass at large radii.

- [Calibrating Mg II-based black-hole mass estimators using Low-to-High-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02990)
    - 用MgII 2798线定single epoch的SMBH质量：We find that the differences in the line profiles between MgII and Hb have significant effects on calibrating the UV \mbh\ estimators.
    - We also find a ∼0.1 dex bias in the \mbh\ estimation due to the difference of the spectral slope in the 2800-5200 \AA\ range

- [NuSTAR hard X-ray spectra of radio galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03293)
    - We present systematic and uniform analyses of 55 NuSTAR spectra for a large sample of 28 radio galaxies, 20 of which are FR II galaxies.
    - The NuSTAR spectra of the majority of our sample are dominated by the thermal corona emission, and the Ecut distribution of the sample is indistinguishable from that of a radio quiet one in literature

### Aug 11

- [A natural boundary of dark matter halo revealed at the minimum bias and maximum infall location](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03477)
    - **Relevant**
    - 定义Halo边界：naturally defined in the halo bias profile as the location of the bias minimum in the quasi-linear scale.
    - Correspond to the maximum infall location in the halo velocity profile, demarcating the transition between a growing halo and the environment being depleted.
    - We show that this depletion boundary is approximately proportional to the conventionally defined splashback radius, and can be interpreted as the radius enclosing a highly complete population of splashback orbits.
    - The depletion radius is approximately 2 times the virial radius and encloses an average density of ~10 times the critical density of the universe

- [Learning Spectral Templates for Photometric Redshift Estimation from Broadband Photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04291)
    - **Relevant**
    - We learn the underlying spectral energy distributions from an ensemble of ∼100K galaxies with measured redshifts and colors.
    - We show that we are able to reconstruct emission and absorption lines at a significantly higher resolution than the broadband filters used to measure the photometry for a sample of 20 spectral templates.

- [Spectro-polarimetric observations of the CIZA J2242.8+5301 northern radio relic: no evidence of high-frequency steepening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03314)
    - Observations of radio relics at very high frequency (>10 GHz) can help to understand how particles age and are (re-)accelerated in galaxy cluster outskirts and how magnetic fields are amplified in these environments.

- [Vibrationally excited HC3N emission in NGC1068: Tracing the recent star formation in the starburst ring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03693)
    - We have detected emission from vibrationally excited HC3N (HC3N*) only towards one star-forming region of the SB ring. Remarkably, HC3N* was not detected towards the CND despite its large HC3N v=0 column density.
    - The very different dust temperatures found for the CND and the proto-SSC indicates that, while the dust in the proto-SSC is being efficiently heated from the inside by the radiation from massive proto-stars, the CND is being heated externally by the AGN, which in the IR optically thin case can only heat the dust to 56 K.

    - [C II] 158μm line cannot be used as a tracer of the star formation rate in heavily obscured systems.
    - Dust inferred gas masses are larger than those inferred from CO observations, suggesting either larger dust-to-H mass ratios, or the presence of hidden atomic H that cannot be inferred from CO observations.

- [High-redshift radio galaxies: a potential new source of 21-cm fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04315)
    - 还是关于EDGES 21-cm信号超出的问题：we take into account the inhomogeneity of the radio background created by a population of high-redshift galaxies, and show that it adds a new type of 21-cm fluctuations to the well-known contributions of density, velocity, Ly-α coupling, heating and reionization.
    - We find that a population of high-redshift galaxies even with a moderately-enhanced radio efficiency (unrelated to the EDGES result) can have a significant effect on the 21-cm power spectrum and global signal in models with weak X-ray heating.

    - We conclude that locally calibrated relations between SFR and radio continuum luminosity remain valid out to z∼2.

- [A model for the formation of stellar associations and clusters from giant molecular clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04453)
    - It is found that once the clouds disperse due to stellar feedback, both self-gravitating star clusters and unbound stars generally remain, which arise from the same underlying continuum of substructured stellar density, ie. the hierarchical cluster formation scenario.
    - The fraction of stars that are born within gravitationally-bound star clusters is related to the overall cloud star formation efficiency set by stellar feedback, but has significant scatter due to stochastic variations
    - Within our model, the ratio of the strength of gravity to stellar feedback is the key parameter setting the masses of star clusters, and of the various feedback channels direct stellar radiation(photon momentum and photoionization) is the most important on GMC scales.

    - Cosmic Reionization On Computers (CROC)模拟，能分辨出LLS来
    - Before reionization most quasar proximity zone sizes grow steadily for ∼10 Myr, while after reionization they grow rapidly but only for ∼0.1 Myr.
    - We find that ∼1−2% of old quasars (30 Myr old) display extremely small proximity zone sizes (<1 proper Mpc), of which the vast majority are due to the occurrence of a damped Lyα absorber (DLA) or a Lyman limit system (LLS) along the line of sight.

    - 基于Vmax和Vpeak的SHAM表现最好，Splitting the total sample into sub-populations, we discover that SHAM overpredicts the clustering of high-mass, blue, star-forming, and late-forming galaxies and uderpredicts that of low-mass, red, quiescent, and early-forming galaxies.

    - 简单的，基于precipitation limit的解析模型：its main free parameter is the central ratio of gas cooling timescale to free-fall timescale (tcool/tff).
    - We find tcool/tff∼50−110, depending on the model extrapolation beyond the halo virial radius and possibly on biases present in the data-sets used in the fitting analysis.
    - However, the best fits for tcool/tff substantially exceed the values typically derived from X-ray observations of individual systems (tcool/tff∼10−30).

- [The correlation of outflow kinematics with star formation rate -- Gas outflows in AGNs. VI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04919)
    - The strength of ionized gas outflows, measured by the velocity dispersion and velocity shift of the \OIII\ emission line, clearly shows a correlation with SFR.
    - Compared to star-forming galaxies in the main sequence, both type 1 and type 2 AGNs show sSFR similar to that of non-AGN galaxies, indicating no instantaneous AGN feedback

- [The MOSDEF Survey: Untangling the Emission-line Properties of z∼2.3 Star-forming Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04924)

    - Star-forming regions in the more offset galaxies are characterized by harder ionizing spectra at fixed nebular oxygen abundance.
    - "High" sample size更小，质量更低，has higher specific star-formation rate and star-formation-rate surface density values and is slightly younger compared to the "low" population.

    - 用总卫星星系光度看SDSS中的AGN的halo质量: Both optically-selected and WISE-selected AGN have L_sat values twice as high as non-active galaxy samples when controlling for stellar mass and mean stellar age. 意味着halo质量更大
    - When only controlling for host galaxy stellar mass, WISE-selected AGN also have higher L_sat values than optical AGN at the factor of two level, consistent with previous results comparing the clustering of obscured and unobscured AGN.
    - Although AGN luminosity correlates with mean stellar age, the difference in stellar age between the WISE and optical samples cannot be fully explained by differences in their AGN luminosity distributions.

- [Fate of stellar bars in minor merger of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04942)
    - We demonstrate that the central stellar bar, initially present in the host galaxy, undergoes a transient bar amplification phase after each pericentre passage of the satellite
    - Once the merger happens, the central stellar bar weakens substantially, followed by a complete destruction of the bar in merger remnant for some models. 并合进来的星系增加了中心区域的恒星质量和角动量，导致了棒结构的削弱。
    - This demonstrates that minor merger of galaxies is a plausible avenue for bar weakening/destruction in disc galaxies.

- [The ubiquity of AGN winds in Seyfert 1 galaxies at low redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04976)
    - In 37% of the Sy1s the outflows appear as broad, blue-shifted, of the [OIII]5007, with a mean maximum velocity V_max ~1014 km/s$, consistent with AGN winds.
    - 分成有宽Balmer线的和只有窄Balmer线的，以及有没有wind的
    - 1. the BH mass is systematically higher and the power-law steeper in the Sy1B-Sy1Bw than in the Sy1N-Sy1Nw
    - 2. V_max is higher in the Sy1Bw than in the Sy1Nw, correlated in both groups with the BH mass and bolometric luminosity
    - 3. the Eddington ratio and SFR are higher in the Sy1 with outflows
    - 4. the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of the Sy1s are normal for their morphology and mass; typical of early-type spiral galaxies in the green valley, far from the quenched regime

- [The NIBLES bivariate luminosity--HI mass distribution function revised using Arecibo follow-up observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05077)
    - Our total follow-up sample consists of 234 galaxies, and it spans the entire luminosity and color range of the parent NIBLES sample of 2600 nearby (900 < cz< 12,000 kms−1) SDSS galaxies.
    - This indicates that while low HI-mass-to-light ratio galaxies do not contribute much to the one-dimensional HIMF, their inclusion has a significant impact on the densities in the two-dimensional distribution.

    - We also find that galaxies at higher halo mass (at constant stellar mass) have younger lookback times, possibly due to a larger reservoir of gas for star formation.
    - An exception to this is a sub sample with high stellar-to-halo mass ratios, which are likely massive, field spirals.
    - 观测和模拟符合得不错，只是具体的assembly time不同，可能是AGN feedback的影响

- [The Star-Formation Properties of the Observed and Simulated AGN Universe: BAT vs EAGLE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05115)
    - After correcting for the known +0.2 dex offset in the SFRs between EAGLE and previous observations, we find agreement in the SFR and X-ray luminosity distributions; however we find that the stellar masses in EAGLE are 0.2−0.4 dex greater than the observational sample, which consequently leads to lower sSFRs.
    - We also use EAGLE to select a sample of AGN host galaxies at high and low redshift and follow their characteristic evolution from z=8 to z=0. We find similar behaviour between these two samples, whereby star formation is quenched when the black hole goes through its phase of most rapid growth.

- [Orbital distribution of infalling satellite halos across cosmic time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05710)
    - we quantify the orbital distribution of subhalos at infall time and its mass and redshift dependence in a large dynamic range 并提供一个可以用于SAM的模型
    - 掉入时的速度分布是universal的，峰值在host的virial速度上；下落轨道在速度接近维里速度时是radially biased的
    - Subhalos that have a higher host mass or a higher sub-to-host ratio tend to move along a more radial direction with a relatively smaller angular momentum than their low host mass or low sub-to-host ratio counterparts
    - The above trends are consistent with the scenario where the dynamical environment is relatively colder for more massive structures because their own gravity is more likely to dominate the local potentials.

- [Perturbation theory for modeling galaxy bias: validation with simulations of the Dark Energy Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05991)
    - **Relevant**
    - We find that an effective PT model with five galaxy bias parameters provides a good description of the 3D correlation functions above scales of 4 Mpc/h and z<1.
    - We also measure the relationship between the non-linear and linear bias parameters and compare them to their expected co-evolution values.

- [Pre-processing, group accretion and the orbital trajectories of associated subhaloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05475)
    - 基于高分辨N-body模拟：We find that roughly 21 per cent of subhaloes within a host's virial radius are currently on first infall, and have not yet reached their first orbital pericentre; roughly 44 per cent are still approaching their first apocentre after infall.
    - 半数的被吸积的系统经历了pre-processed，20%是以在星系群中被一起吸积
    - We confirm that the entire population of accreted subhaloes - often referred to as "associated" subhaloes -- extend far beyond the virial radii of their hosts, with roughly half currently residing at distances that exceed ≈1.2×r200
    - Many of these backsplash haloes have gained orbital energy since infall, and occupy extreme orbits that carry them well past their initial turnaround radii.
    - Within 2 virial radii from host centres, the concentrations of first-infall halos are remarkably similar those of isolated field halos, whereas backsplash haloes, as well as systems that were pre-processed, are considerably more concentrated.

    - We study satellite galaxy populations as a function of host stellar mass 9.5< log(M∗/M⊙)<10.5 and redshifts 0.1< z<0.8 in the COSMOS survey
    - We find that the satellite populations of low-mass host galaxies, which we measure down to satellite masses equivalent to the Fornax dwarf spheroidal satellite of the Milky Way, remain mostly unchanged through time.
    - We test the constraining power of our measured cumulative luminosity function to calculate the low-mass end slope of the M∗−Mhalo relation. These new satellite luminosity function measurements are consistent with ΛCDM predictions

- [The Kinematics and Dark Matter Fractions of TNG50 Galaxies at z=2 from an Observational Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05486)
    - 用TNG50模拟高红移SFG观测，主要是和Genzel et al. (2020)的观测结果比较：The simulated galaxies show clear signs of disc rotation but mostly exhibit more asymmetric rotation curves, partly due to large intrinsic radial and vertical velocity components.
    - From dynamical modelling we infer rotation speeds and velocity dispersions that are in the ballpark of observational results. We find low central dark matter fractions compatible with observations (fvDM(<Re)=v2DM(Re)/v2circ(Re)∼0.29±0.11)
    - 但是盘的有效半径太小了：at fixed Re the TNG50 dark matter fractions are too high by factors of 1.5−5.

- [On the Evolution of the Globular Cluster System in NGC 1052-DF2: Dynamical Friction, Globular-Globular Interactions and Galactic Tides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05490)
    - As the velocity dispersion among the GCs is comparable to the expected internal dispersions of the individual GCs, the galaxy might be highly conducive to GC-GC merging. 也许可以解释奇怪的GCLF
    - 进行了新的模拟：Somewhat surprisingly, we infer a low merger rate of ∼0.03 Gyr−1. The main reason is that the GCs are too dense for tidal shock capture, caused by impulsive encounters among them, to operate efficiently (we infer a tidal capture rate of only ∼0.002 Gyr−1).
    - The low merger rate inferred here makes it unlikely that the unusually large luminosities of the GCs can be explained as a result of past GC-GC mergers.
    - We predict that it is improbable for the GCs to reveal tidal features, something that can be tested with future deep observations.

- [The Palomar Transient Factory Core-Collapse Supernova Host-Galaxy Sample. I. Host-Galaxy Distribution Functions and Environment-Dependence of CCSNe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05988)
    - This sample includes 888 SNe of 12 distinct classes out to redshift z≈1
    - The galaxy mass functions of Type Ic, Ib, IIb, II, and IIn SNe ranges from 105 to 1011.5 M⊙, probing the entire mass range of star-forming galaxies down to the least-massive star-forming galaxies known.
    - The galaxy mass distributions are consistent with models of star-formation-weighted mass functions. Regular CCSNe are hence direct tracers of star formation
    - Type Ib/c SNe prefer galaxies with slightly higher masses (i.e., higher metallicities) and star-formation rates than Type IIb and II SNe
    - H-poor SLSNe and SNe~Ic-BL are scarce in galaxies above 1010 M⊙. Their progenitors require environments with metallicities of <0.4 and <1 solar 年轻星族年龄，低金属丰度对SLSNe很重要

- [Effects of environment on stellar metallicity profiles of late-type galaxies in the CALIFA survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06012)
    - We find significant differences between group and field late-type galaxies in terms of their metallicity, in the sense that group galaxies are systematically more metallic than their field counterparts.
    - We find that field galaxies have, in general, metallicity profiles that show a negative gradient in their inner regions, and a shallower profile at larger radii. This contrasts with the metallicity profiles of galaxies in groups, which tend to be flat in the inner regions, and to have a negative gradient in the outer parts.

    - There is tentative evidence that Seyferts tend to show more polarized structures than starburst galaxies at the resolution of our observations.
    - We find that unlike a sample of Seyfert galaxies hosting kilo-parsec scale radio (KSR) emission, starburst galaxies with superwinds do not show radio-excess compared to the radio-FIR correlation. This suggests that shock acceleration is not adequate to explain the excess radio emission seen in Seyferts and hence most likely have a jet-related origin.
    - We find that the power contribution of AGN jet, AGN accretion, and star formation is more or less comparable in our sample of Seyfert galaxies.

    - 2% precision has been achieved with 7 Time-Delay Cosmography (TDCOSMO) lenses
    - However, without assumptions on the radial mass density profile -- and relying exclusively on stellar kinematics to break the mass-sheet degeneracy - the precision drops to 8\% with the current data of the 7 TDCOSMO lenses
    - 基于Birrer+2020，讨论在不假设mass profile的情况下考虑mass-sheet简并
    - With existing samples and technology, 3.3\% precision on H0 can be reached by adding spatially resolved kinematics of the 7 TDCOSMO lenses. The precision improves to 2.5\% with the further addition of kinematics for 50 non-time-delay lenses from SLACS and the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S).
    - Expanding the samples to 40 time delay and 200 non-time delay lenses will improve the precision to 1.5\% and 1.2\%, respectively.

    - HST八年的观测：Our final results for the PMs are (μW,μN)N147=(−0.0232,0.0378)±(0.0143,0.0146)masyr−1 for NGC 147, and (μW,μN)N185=(−0.0242,0.0058)±(0.0141,0.0147)masyr−1 for NGC 185.
    - The 2-dimensional direction of motion for NGC 147 about M31 is found to be aligned with its tidal tails
    - Our PMs show that the orbital poles of NGC 147, and also NGC 185 albeit to a lesser degree, agree within the uncertainties with the normal of the Great Plane of Andromeda (GPoA).
    - Our results strengthen the hypothesis that the GPoA may be a dynamically coherent entity

- [First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) II: The Photometric Properties of High-Redshift Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06057)
    - FLARES predicts a significantly larger number of intrinsically bright galaxies, which can be explained through a simple model linking dust-attenuation to the metal content of the interstellar medium, using a line-of-sight (LOS) extinction model
    - We show that the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) matches the observations at all redshifts. The function is fit by Schechter and double power-law forms, with the latter being favoured at these redshifts by the FLARES
    - The impact of environment on the UV LF is also explored, with the brightest galaxies forming in the densest environments.

- [Optically-Thin Spatially-Resolved Mg II Emission Maps the Escape of Ionizing Photons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06059)
    - KCWI观测：the resonant Mg II 2800 doublet from a redshift 0.36 galaxy, J1503+3644, with a previously observed escape fraction of 6%.
    - The Mg II emission has a similar spatial extent as the stellar continuum, and each of the Mg II doublet lines are well-fit by single Gaussians.
    - The Mg II is optically thin. The intrinsic flux ratio of the red and blue Mg II emission line doublet, R=F2796/F2803, is set by atomic physics to be two, but Mg+ gas along the line of sight decreases R proportional to the Mg II optical depth. Combined with the metallicity, R estimates the neutral gas column density.
    - The observed R ranges across the galaxy from 0.8-2.7, implying a factor of 2 spatial variation of the relative escape fraction. All of the ionizing photons that escape J1503+3644 pass through regions of high R.

- [Faint Stars in a Faint Galaxy: I. Ultra Deep Photometry of the Boötes I Ultra Faint Dwarf Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06089)
    - HST观测：The probable members lie close to stellar isochrones that were chosen to encompass the known metallicity distribution derived from spectroscopic data of brighter radial-velocity member stars and are consistent with the main-sequence turnoff. The resulting luminosity function of the Bootes I galaxy has a 50% completeness limit of 27.4 in F814W and 28.2 in F606W (Vega magnitude system), which corresponds to a limiting stellar mass of ≤0.3M⊙

- [Biasing relation, environmental dependencies and estimation of the growth rate from line emission galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06541)
    - 用SAM研究SFR和DM的关系，search for environmental dependencies and assess their impact on the Speed-from-Light Method (SfLM) to measure the growth rate, f from luminosity/SFR shifts.
    - Quiescent galaxies are more clustered relative to the DM than the star forming ones from z=1 to the present epoch
    - The linear bias factor, b, defined as the clustering ratio of galaxies to DM, is roughly a scale-independent, constant function of the SFR for star forming galaxies.
    - For the majority of the models the SFR probability distribution is skewed to larger values in denser regions.

- [Forecasting Cosmological Constraints from the Weak Lensing Magnification of Type Ia Supernovae Measured by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06804)
    - **Interesting**
    - We present a methodology for reconstructing the probability distribution of the weak lensing magnification μ of SNe Ia, p(μ), from observational data, and using it to constrain cosmological parameters.
    - 放大率分布可以用一个stretched Gaussian分布来描述，can be used to measure the variance of μ, ξμ
    - The combination of SN Ia weak lensing magnification and distance measurements result in a ∼ 10% measurement on σ8.

- [Validating a minimal galaxy bias method for cosmological parameter inference using HSC-SDSS mock catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06873)
    - We assess the performance of a perturbation theory inspired method for inferring cosmological parameters from the joint measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing (ΔΣ) and the projected galaxy clustering (wp).
    - As long as the appropriate scale cuts, 12 and 8 h−1Mpc for ΔΣ and wp respectively, are adopted, a "minimal-bias" model using the linear bias parameter b1 alone and the nonlinear matter power spectrum can recover the true cosmological parameters (here focused on Ωm and σ8) to within the 68% credible interval
    - This is as expected if physical processes inherent in galaxy formation/evolution are confined to local, small scales below the scale cut, and thus implies that real-space observables have an advantage in filtering out the impact of small-scale nonlinear effects in parameter estimation, compared to their Fourier-space counterparts.

- [Photometric classification of HSC transients using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06726)
    - This machine is trained by actual observed cadence and filter combinations such that we can directly input the observed data array into the machine without any interpretation.
    - Our classifier scores an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 for binary classification (SN Ia or non-SN Ia) and 95.3% accuracy for three-class classification (SN Ia, SN Ibc, or SN II).

- [The Star-Forming Main Sequence and the contribution of dust-obscured star formation over the last 12 Gyrs from the FUV+IR luminosity functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06514)
    - **Important**
    - At any redshift, we find that the specific SFR−M∗ relation for MS SFGs approaches to a power law at the high-mass end. At lower masses it bends and eventually the slope sign changes from negative to positive at very low masses.
    - The slope sign change is related to the knee of the FUV LF.
    - We predict that the assembly time of nearby dwarf galaxies is ∼10 Gyrs consistent with their oldest observed stellar populations.
    - Using the joint evolution of the GSMF and the FUV and IR LFs is a promising empirical approach to study the stellar mass growth and dust formation/destruction mechanisms, and ultimately to constrain galaxy formation models.

- [Tidal forces from the wake of dynamical friction: warps, lopsidedness and kinematic misalignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07177)
    - A galaxy moving through a background of dark matter particles, induces an overdensity of these particles or a wake behind it. The back reaction of this wake on the galaxy is a force field that can be decomposed into an effective deceleration (called dynamical friction) and a tidal field.
    - 用孤立且lopsided的星系IC2487为例子去看这个作用力是否能产生warps，lopsidedness等结构
    - We conclude that the proposed mechanism can generate warps, lopsidedness and misalignments observed in isolated galaxies or galaxies in loose groups.

- [The OH Megamaser galaxy IRAS11506-3851: an AGN and starformation revealed by multiwavelength observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07442)
    - The HST images reveal an isolated spiral galaxy and the combination with the GMOS-IFU flux distributions and VLA data allow us to identify a partial ring of star-forming regions surrounding the nucleus with a radius of ~ 500 pc.
    - The enhanced excitation and velocity dispersion of this bubble surrounds a 8.5 GHz radio emission structure, supporting its origin in a faint AGN that is mostly shocking the surrounding gas via a plasma ejection seen in radio at the present stage
