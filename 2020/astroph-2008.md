- [Milky Way Satellite Census. III. Constraints on Dark Matter Properties from Observations of Milky Way Satellite Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00022)
    - Our results are consistent with the cold, collisionless DM paradigm and yield the strongest cosmological constraints to date on particle models of warm, interacting, and fuzzy dark matter.

- [Standard candles and sirens rescue H0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00869)
    - 用双中子星并合电磁波对应体观测和SNIa观测联合限制宇宙学：The luminosity distance inferred from these probes and its scatter depend on the underlying cosmology. By using the gravitatonal lensing of light or gravitational waves emitted by, and peculiar motion of, these systems we derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, the equation of state of dark energy parametrised in the form w0+wa(1−a), along with the Hubble constant and cold dark matter density in the Universe

- [Fast radio bursts to be detected with the Square Kilometre Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00007)
    - The occurrence rates of non-repeating and repeating FRBs could be controlled by the cosmic stellar-mass density (CSMD) and star formation-rate density (CSFRD), respectively.
    - 分别给出SKA观测的预测：At z≳2, z≳6 and z≳10, non-repeating FRBs will be detected with the SKA at a rate of ∼104, ∼102, and ∼10 (sky−1 day−1), respectively, if their luminosity function follows the CSMD evolution. At z≳1, z≳2, and z≳4, sources of repeating FRBs will be detected at a rate of ∼103, ∼102, and ≲10 (sky−1 day−1), respectively, assuming that the redshift evolution of their luminosity function is scaled with the CSFRD.

- [Quenched fractions in the IllustrisTNG simulations: comparison with observations and other theoretical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00004)
    - **Relevant**
    - TNG300: The definition used to separate quenched and star-forming galaxies produces differences of up to 70 (30)% for centrals (satellites) >∼10^10.5M⊙ 增大计算SFR的孔径可以压低quenched fraction
    - Taking projected rather than 3D distances for satellites decreases the quenched fractions by up to 10% due to field contamination. 考虑各种因素后，TNG和观测符合得可以

- [Quenched fractions in the IllustrisTNG simulations: comparison with observations and other theoretical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00004)
    - **Relevant**
    - TNG predicts a quenched fraction of ∼70−90% (on average) for centrals and satellites ≳10^10.5M⊙, regardless of host mass, cosmic time (0≤z≤0.5), clustercentric distance and time since infall in the z=0
    - The fraction of low-mass passive galaxies is higher closer to the host center and for more massive hosts.
    - In fact, ∼30% of group and cluster satellites that are quenched at z=0 were already quenched before falling into their current host, and the bulk of them quenched as early as 4 to 10 billion years ago.

- [SMASHing the low surface brightness SMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00012)
    - SMC的很深的CMD研究：Special care was taken in the decontamination of our data from MW foreground stars, including from foreground globular clusters NGC 362 and 47 Tuc.
    - 重构SBF以及stellar density分布：This approach, based on stellar counts of the oldest main sequence turn-off (MSTO) stars, uncovered a tidally disrupted stellar feature that reaches as far out as 12 degrees from the SMC centre. We also serendipitously found a faint feature of unknown origin located at ∼14 degrees from the centre of the SMC and that we tentatively associated to a more distant structure.

- [MEGARA-IFU detection of extended HeII4686 nebular emission in the central region of NGC1569 and its ionization budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00320)
    - GTC观测：the detection of extended HeII4686 nebular emission in the central region of NGC1569
    - We infer 124+/-11 Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in SSC-A using the HeII4686 broad feature and Av=2.3 mag. 这些WR星的电离可以解释HeII线

- [SPT-CL J2032-5627: a new Southern double relic cluster observed with ASKAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00660)
    - ASKAP观测 943 MHz shows two previously undetected radio relics at either side of the cluster； both have steep integrated radio spectra (αSE=−1.33±0.10 and αNW,full=−1.16±0.12
    - These low-power radio relics will become more prevalent in upcoming large-area radio surveys such as the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU).

### Aug 4

- [Characterizing galaxy clusters by their gravitational potential: systematics of cluster potential reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01107)
    - **Relevant**
    - We aim to demonstrate that the systematics associated with cluster gravitational potentials are smaller than the hydrostatic mass bias and that cluster potentials could therefore be a good alternative to cluster masses in cosmological studies.
    - 用模拟验证：We find that the bias in the reconstructed potential (6%) is less than that of the HE mass (13%), and that the scatter in the reconstructed potential decreases by about 35% with respect to that in the HE mass.

- [Galaxy-group (halo) alignments from SDSS DR7 and the ELUCID simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01381)
    - In observation, the major axes of galaxies are found to be preferentially aligned to the major axes of their host groups. 颜色红的central的alignment更强
    - We also find that central galaxies have their major axes to be aligned to the major axes of their corresponding subhalos in the ELUCID simulation 质量越大的halo里信号越强

- [Hot gaseous atmospheres of rotating galaxies observed with XMM-Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01161)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    - 看旋转占主导的早型星系的X-ray辐射 We present an analysis of the hot atmospheres of six lenticulars and a spiral galaxy to study the effects of angular momentum on the hot gas properties
    - We find an alignment between the hot gas and the stellar distribution, with the ellipticity of the X-ray emission generally lower than that of the optical stellar emission
    - The entropy profiles of NGC 4382 and the massive spiral galaxy NGC 1961 are significantly shallower than the entropy distribution in other galaxies, suggesting the presence of strong heating (via outflows or compressional) in the central regions of these systems

- [CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING). X. Physical conditions of molecular gas and the local SFR-Mass relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01287)
    - 近邻SFMS星系的Nobeyama CO探测：We find that (1) ratio of 12CO to 13CO lines (R1213) positively correlates to specific star-formation rate (sSFR) with a correlation coefficient of 0.46
    - Our results support the scenario where R1213 variation is mainly caused by the changes in molecular-gas properties such as temperature and turbulence

- [Dynamical state for 964 galaxy clusters from Chandra X-ray images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01299)
    - **Relevant**
    - 多种方式描述X-ray形态和星系团动力学状态：Three widely used indicators for dynamical state, the concentration index c, the centroid shift omega and the power ratio P3/P0 are calculated in the circular central region with a radius of 500 kpc.
    - For a large sample of clusters, the dynamical parameters are continuously distributed from the disturbed to relaxed states with a peak in the between, rather than the bimodal distribution for the two states.
    - The offset between masses estimated from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and X-ray images depends on dynamical parameters.

- [LESSER: A Catalogue of Spectroscopically selected sample of Lyman-α Emitters Lensed By Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01361)
    - Search for lensed LAEs in eBOSS: The final catalog contains 361 candidate lensing systems.
    - 0.4 < z < 0.8的LRG作为lens: Among our lensed LAE candidates, 281 systems present single-peaked line profiles while 80 systems show double-peaked features.

- [The halo of M105 and its group environment as traced by planetary nebula populations: I. Wide-field photometric survey of planetary nebulae in the Leo I group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01696)
    - **Relevant**
    - We use PNe as discrete stellar tracers of the diffuse light around M105: We identify 226 PNe candidates within a limiting magnitude of mlim = 28.1 from our Subaru-SuprimeCam imaging, covering 67.6 kpc along the major axis of M105 and the halos of NGC 3384 and NGC 3398.
    - We find an excess of PNe at large radii compared to the stellar surface brightness profile from broad-band surveys: We infer that the radial variation of the PN population properties is due to a diffuse population of metal-poor stars ([M/H] < -1.0) following an exponential profile, in addition to the M105 halo.

### Aug 5

- [Revealing the Local Cosmic Web by Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01738)
    - Here we show that we can reconstruct the Cosmic Web from the galaxy distribution using the convolutional-neural-network based deep-learning algorithm.
    - 在TNG上学习的模型可以重现Eagle的结果；然后应用到Cosmicflow-3上

- [Deconstructing the Planck TT Power Spectrum to Constrain Deviations from ΛCDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01785)
    - we modify the CLASS Boltzmann code to create phenomenological amplitudes, similar to the lensing amplitude parameter AL, for the Sachs-Wolfe, Doppler, early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (eISW), and Polarization contributions to the CMB temperature anisotropy, and then we include these additional amplitudes in fits to the Planck TT power spectrum.
    - 单独考虑每个都不能产生改变，each of these physical effects are being correctly accounted for given the current level of precision.
    - We test adding our phenomenological amplitudes as well as Neff, YHe, and nrun to LCDM + AL and find that none of these model extensions provide significant improvement over LCDM + AL when fitting Planck temperature data.

- [The Halo Spin Transition as a Probe of Dark Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02121)
    - Mass-dependent transitions of the halo spin orientations from the intermediate to the minor principal directions of the local tidal fields can in principle be a useful discriminator of dark energy models.
    - 看在不同的DE模型下，spin transition zone对应的halo质量如何变化
    - Noting that a narrower spin transition zone is more powerful as a probe of dark energy, we also show that the spin transition zones become narrower at higher redshifts, in the filamentary environments and for the case that the tidal fields are smoothed on the smaller scales.
    - Spin transition zone对应的质量区间反应的是潮汐场的非线性演化的速度

- [SUPER-II: Spatially resolved ionized gas kinematics and scaling relations in z~2 AGN host galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01728)
    - SINFONI观测21个Type-I AGN: We detect outflows in all the Type-1 AGN sample based on the w80 value from the integrated spectrum, which is in the range 650-2700 km/s.
    - [OIII] emission is spatially resolved for ∼35% of the Type-1 sample and the outflows show an extension up to ∼6 kpc.
    - The relation between maximum velocity and the bolometric luminosity is consistent with model predictions for shocks from an AGN driven outflow.
    - The escape fraction of the outflowing gas increase with the AGN luminosity, although for most galaxies, this fraction is less than 10%.

- [The nature of CR7 revealed with MUSE: a young starburst powering extended Lyman-α emission at z=6.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01731)
    - MUSE观测这个有多成分的明亮高红移LAE：We measure extended emission with a similar halo scale length as typical LAEs at z≈5. CR7's Lyα halo is clearly elongated along the direction connecting the multiple components, likely tracing the underlying gas distribution.
    - the MUSE data show that the rest-frame Lyα equivalent width (EW) is ≈100 {\AA}. This is a factor four higher than the EW measured in low-redshift analogues with carefully matched Lyα profiles 但可以用SF解释
    - 大部分的Lya发射都来自最亮的UV成分
    - 不需要AGN来解释：CR7's Lyα emission, while extremely luminous, resembles the emission in more common LAEs at lower redshifts very well and is likely powered by a young metal poor starburst.

- [Statistical correlation between the distribution of Lyα emitters and IGM HI at z∼2.2 mapped by Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01733)
    - 看z=2.2处很强的Lya吸收处附近的星系分布：Combining the sample with the Lyα absorption estimated from 64 (e)BOSS quasar spectra, we find a moderate to strong correlation between the LAE overdensity δLAE and the effective optical depth τLoS in line-of-sights
    - The cross-correlation analysis also clearly suggests that up to 4±1 pMpc, LAEs tend to cluster in the regions rich in HI gas, indicated by the high τLoS
    - we find a 30% excess signal at 2σ level at d<200 pkpc, indicating the dense HI in circumgalactic medium, and a tentative excess at 400< d <600 pkpc in IGM regime

- [Substructure in the Globular Cluster Populations of the Virgo Cluster Elliptical Galaxies M84 and M86](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01737)
    - **Relevant**
    - M84/86附近找GC子结构：a peak in the projected number density of globular clusters in M86 that is offset from the system center and may be at least partly due to the presence of the dwarf elliptical galaxy NGC 4406B; a bridge that connects the M84 and M86 globular cluster systems; and a boxy iso-density contour along the southeast side of the M86 globular cluster system.
    - 子结构中主要是blue GC population

- [A SOFIA Survey of [CII] in the galaxy M51 II. [CII] and CO kinematics across spiral arms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01745)
    - Our data show strong velocity gradients in HI, 12CO, and [CII] at the locations of stellar arms (traced by K--band data) with a clear offset in position-velocity space between upstream molecular gas (traced by 12CO) and downstream star formation (traced by [CII]).
    - Our observations, based on the observed velocity gradients and associated offset between CO and [CII], are consistent with the presence of shocks in spiral arms in the inner parts of M51 and in the arm connecting the companion galaxy, M51b, in the outer parts of M51.

- [Arepo-MCRT: Monte Carlo Radiation Hydrodynamics on a Moving Mesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01750)

- [The Next Generation X-ray Galaxy Survey with eROSITA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01870)
    - eROSITA will contribute significantly to X-ray studies of normal (i.e., not AGN) galaxies.
    - Starting from multi-wavelength catalogues, we measure star formation rates and stellar masses for 60 212 galaxies constrained to distances of 50-200 Mpc. 结合X-ray scaling relation以及eROSITA仪器特性，预测XRB和弥散气体的X-ray光度
    - We predict that the eROSITA 4-year survey, will detect ≳ 15 000 galaxies (3 σ significance) at 50-200 Mpc, which is ~100X more normal galaxies than detected in any X-ray survey to date.

- [A large-scale, regular intergalactic magnetic field associated with Stephan's Quintet?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01881)
    - WSRT的Rotation Measure Synthesis观测：We recognise the signature of a large-scale, genuinely regular, magnetised screen, seemingly constrained to the Quintet itself.
    - If indeed associated with the galaxy group in question, it would span a volume of at least 60×40×20kpc and have a strength at least as high as that previously detected within large spiral galaxies. 但仍不能完全排除来自银河系

- [Is extended hard X-ray emission ubiquitous in Compton-thick AGN?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02175)

    - We present the spatial analysis results of a pilot Chandra imaging survey of 7 nearby (0.006< z<0.013) CT AGN: 5/7都有延展硬X-ray发射
    - ESO 137-G034 and NGC 3281 display biconical ionization structures with extended hard X-ray emission reaching kpc-scales (∼ 1.9 kpc and 3.5 kpc in diameter).

- [Inverted metallicity gradients in two Virgo star-forming dwarfs: evidence of recent merging?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02212)
    - 气态丰度测量：The galaxies show positive gas metallicity gradients, contrarily to what is usually found in other dwarfs or in spiral galaxies. We measure gradient slopes of 0.20 ± 0.06 and 0.15 ± 0.03 dex/Re for VCC135 and VCC324
    - The presence of weak underlying substructures in both galaxies and the analysis of morphological diagnostics and of ionised gas kinematics suggest that the inflow of metal-poor gas to the central regions of the dwarfs may be related to a recent merging event with a gas-rich companion.

### Aug 6

- [Artificial intelligence and quasar absorption system modelling; application to fundamental constants at high redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02583)
    - 针对HIRES和ESPRESSO的基于AI的分析工具：The new method forms a sophisticated parallelised system, eliminating human decision-making and hence bias
    - The results show that modelling line broadening for high-redshift absorption components should include both thermal and turbulent components.

- [Exploring reionisation and high-z galaxy observables with recent multi-redshift MWA upper limits on the 21-cm signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02639)
    - We use the latest multi-redshift (z=6.5−8.7) upper limits on the 21-cm signal from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to explore astrophysical models which are inconsistent with the data.
    - We find the vast majority of models disfavoured by the MWA limits are already inconsistent with existing observational constraints. These inconsistent models arise from two classes of models: (i) `cold' reionisation and (ii) pure matter density fluctuations (i.e. no reionisation).

- [Probing the Milky Way's Dark Matter Halo for the 3.5 keV Line](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02283)
    - A comprehensive search for the 3.5 keV line, using ∼51 Ms of archival Chandra observations peering through the Milky Way's Dark Matter Halo from across the entirety of the sky.
    - A non-detection is reported in the total data set, allowing us to set an upper-limit on 3.5 keV line flux and constrain the sterile neutrino dark matter mixing angle.
    - Non-detections are reported in all radial data subsets, allowing us to constrain the spatial profile of 3.5 keV line intensity, which does not conclusively differ from Navarro-Frenk-White predictions.

- [REQUIEM-2D: Spatially Resolved Stellar Populations from HST 2D Grism Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02276)
    - **Interesting, CSST**

    - A significant correlation is found between the X-ray–to–optical power-law slope parameter (αOX) and the 2500 ˚A monochromatic luminosity
    - We demonstrate the existence of a population of non-BAL X-ray weak quasars, and the fractions of quasars that are X-ray weak by factors of ≥ 6 and ≥ 10 are 5.8 ± 0.7% and 2.7 ± 0.5%, respectively

- [The MOSDEF-LRIS Survey: The Connection Between Massive Stars and Ionized Gas in Individual Galaxies at z∼2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02277)
    - BPASS+Cloudy拟合z=2.3的rest-UV spectra
    - Our high-SNR subsample is characterized by a median ionization parameter and oxygen abundance, respectively, of log(U)med=−2.98±0.25 and 12+log(O/H)med=8.48±0.11.
    - Accordingly, we find that all galaxies in our sample show evidence for α-enhancement.
    - We find that the local relationship between ionization parameter and metallicity applies at z∼2.
    - The ubiquity of α-enhancement among z∼2.3 star-forming galaxies indicates important differences between high-redshift and local galaxies that must be accounted for in order to derive physical properties at high redshift.

- [Baryons Shaping Dark Matter Haloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02404)
    - **Relevant**
    - Fenix和Eagle模拟中的DM halo的DMO和Hydro-run比较
    - Our results indicate that baryons have a significant impact on the shape of the inner halo, mainly within ∼ 20 percent of the virial radius. 在有重子过程的时候，halo变得更spherical
    - Our findings also indicate that disc galaxies preferentially form in haloes whose DMo counterparts were originally more spherical and with stronger velocity anisotropy

- [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: A Range in S0 Properties Indicating Multiple Formation Pathways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02426)
    - **Relevant**
    - A simulated merger pathway involving a compact elliptical and gas-rich satellite results in an S0 that lies within the pressure-supported group. We conclude that two S0 formation pathways are active, with mergers dominating in isolated galaxies and smal groups, and the faded spiral pathway being most prominent in large groups (10^13 < Mhalo < 10^14).

- [The turbulent gas structure in the centers of NGC253 and the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02518)

- [A Wide-area GMRT 610~MHz survey of ELAIS N1 field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02530)
    - The primary goal of the survey was to study the polarised sky at sub-mJy flux densities at < GHz frequencies.

    - 新的统计测量：the probability distribution function (PDF) of relative velocity between two different dark matter halos (i.e. pairwise velocity)
    - We demonstrate that our model of the pairwise velocity PDF provides an accurate mapping of the two-point clustering of massive-galaxy-sized halos at the scales of O(10)h−1Mpc between redshift and real space for a given real-space correlation function.
    - Our model of the pairwise velocity PDF will give a detailed explanation of statistics of massive galaxies at the intermediate scales in redshift surveys, including the non-linear redshift-space distortion effect in two-point correlation functions and the measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.

- [The mass function dependence on dark matter haloes dynamical state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03179)
    - **Relevant**
    - 基于MultiDark模拟：We measure the mean relations of concentration, offset and spin as a function of halo mass and redshift and their distributions
    - Halo concentration在大质量端升高；The concentration of low mass haloes shows a faster redshift evolution, especially in the high concentration regime.
    - The offset parameter is smaller at low redshift, in agreement with the relaxation of structures at recent times.
    - 给出一个能预测不同Spin和offset下HMF的模型：This model allows to marginalize over the cool-core bias while constraining cosmological parameters with X-ray selected clusters.

- [Quenching timescales of dwarf satellites around Milky Way-mass hosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02805)
    - DC Justice League模拟里看dwarf satellites的quenched fraction：能够重现比较高的quenched fraction
    - We then trace the histories of satellite galaxies back to z∼15, and find that many satellites with M∗∼10^6−8 solar masses quench within 2 Gyr of infall into the host halo, while others in the same mass range remain star-forming for as long as 5 Gyr.
    - We show that this scatter can be explained by the satellite's gas mass and the ram pressure it feels at infall.
    - 10^8 Msun是一个特征质量，比这个质量更低的卫星的quenching的速度很快

- [Color gradients along the quiescent galaxy sequence: clues to quenching and structural growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02817)
    - **Relevant**
    - CANDELS中的quiescent星系：the youngest quiescent galaxies are not significantly smaller than older quiescent galaxies at fixed stellar mass.
    - These `post-starburst' galaxies only appear smaller in half-light radii because they have systematically flatter color gradients.
    - 年龄和颜色梯度有相关：越老的星系的color gradient越negative
    - We find that the central mass surface density Σ1 is independent of age at fixed stellar mass, and only weakly depends on redshift. 中心区域的质量基本不变化
    - We find that older quiescent galaxies have additional mass at large radii.

- [Calibrating Mg II-based black-hole mass estimators using Low-to-High-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02990)
    - 用MgII 2798线定single epoch的SMBH质量：We find that the differences in the line profiles between MgII and Hb have significant effects on calibrating the UV \mbh\ estimators.
    - We also find a ∼0.1 dex bias in the \mbh\ estimation due to the difference of the spectral slope in the 2800-5200 \AA\ range

- [NuSTAR hard X-ray spectra of radio galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03293)
    - We present systematic and uniform analyses of 55 NuSTAR spectra for a large sample of 28 radio galaxies, 20 of which are FR II galaxies.
    - The NuSTAR spectra of the majority of our sample are dominated by the thermal corona emission, and the Ecut distribution of the sample is indistinguishable from that of a radio quiet one in literature

### Aug 11

- [A natural boundary of dark matter halo revealed at the minimum bias and maximum infall location](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03477)
    - **Relevant**
    - 定义Halo边界：naturally defined in the halo bias profile as the location of the bias minimum in the quasi-linear scale.
    - Correspond to the maximum infall location in the halo velocity profile, demarcating the transition between a growing halo and the environment being depleted.
    - We show that this depletion boundary is approximately proportional to the conventionally defined splashback radius, and can be interpreted as the radius enclosing a highly complete population of splashback orbits.
    - The depletion radius is approximately 2 times the virial radius and encloses an average density of ~10 times the critical density of the universe

- [Learning Spectral Templates for Photometric Redshift Estimation from Broadband Photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04291)
    - **Relevant**
    - We learn the underlying spectral energy distributions from an ensemble of ∼100K galaxies with measured redshifts and colors.
    - We show that we are able to reconstruct emission and absorption lines at a significantly higher resolution than the broadband filters used to measure the photometry for a sample of 20 spectral templates.

- [Spectro-polarimetric observations of the CIZA J2242.8+5301 northern radio relic: no evidence of high-frequency steepening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03314)
    - Observations of radio relics at very high frequency (>10 GHz) can help to understand how particles age and are (re-)accelerated in galaxy cluster outskirts and how magnetic fields are amplified in these environments.

- [Vibrationally excited HC3N emission in NGC1068: Tracing the recent star formation in the starburst ring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03693)
    - We have detected emission from vibrationally excited HC3N (HC3N*) only towards one star-forming region of the SB ring. Remarkably, HC3N* was not detected towards the CND despite its large HC3N v=0 column density.
    - The very different dust temperatures found for the CND and the proto-SSC indicates that, while the dust in the proto-SSC is being efficiently heated from the inside by the radiation from massive proto-stars, the CND is being heated externally by the AGN, which in the IR optically thin case can only heat the dust to 56 K.

    - [C II] 158μm line cannot be used as a tracer of the star formation rate in heavily obscured systems.
    - Dust inferred gas masses are larger than those inferred from CO observations, suggesting either larger dust-to-H mass ratios, or the presence of hidden atomic H that cannot be inferred from CO observations.

- [High-redshift radio galaxies: a potential new source of 21-cm fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04315)
    - 还是关于EDGES 21-cm信号超出的问题：we take into account the inhomogeneity of the radio background created by a population of high-redshift galaxies, and show that it adds a new type of 21-cm fluctuations to the well-known contributions of density, velocity, Ly-α coupling, heating and reionization.
    - We find that a population of high-redshift galaxies even with a moderately-enhanced radio efficiency (unrelated to the EDGES result) can have a significant effect on the 21-cm power spectrum and global signal in models with weak X-ray heating.

    - We conclude that locally calibrated relations between SFR and radio continuum luminosity remain valid out to z∼2.

- [A model for the formation of stellar associations and clusters from giant molecular clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04453)
    - It is found that once the clouds disperse due to stellar feedback, both self-gravitating star clusters and unbound stars generally remain, which arise from the same underlying continuum of substructured stellar density, ie. the hierarchical cluster formation scenario.
    - The fraction of stars that are born within gravitationally-bound star clusters is related to the overall cloud star formation efficiency set by stellar feedback, but has significant scatter due to stochastic variations
    - Within our model, the ratio of the strength of gravity to stellar feedback is the key parameter setting the masses of star clusters, and of the various feedback channels direct stellar radiation(photon momentum and photoionization) is the most important on GMC scales.

    - Cosmic Reionization On Computers (CROC)模拟，能分辨出LLS来
    - Before reionization most quasar proximity zone sizes grow steadily for ∼10 Myr, while after reionization they grow rapidly but only for ∼0.1 Myr.
    - We find that ∼1−2% of old quasars (30 Myr old) display extremely small proximity zone sizes (<1 proper Mpc), of which the vast majority are due to the occurrence of a damped Lyα absorber (DLA) or a Lyman limit system (LLS) along the line of sight.

    - 基于Vmax和Vpeak的SHAM表现最好，Splitting the total sample into sub-populations, we discover that SHAM overpredicts the clustering of high-mass, blue, star-forming, and late-forming galaxies and uderpredicts that of low-mass, red, quiescent, and early-forming galaxies.

    - 简单的，基于precipitation limit的解析模型：its main free parameter is the central ratio of gas cooling timescale to free-fall timescale (tcool/tff).
    - We find tcool/tff∼50−110, depending on the model extrapolation beyond the halo virial radius and possibly on biases present in the data-sets used in the fitting analysis.
    - However, the best fits for tcool/tff substantially exceed the values typically derived from X-ray observations of individual systems (tcool/tff∼10−30).

- [The correlation of outflow kinematics with star formation rate -- Gas outflows in AGNs. VI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04919)
    - The strength of ionized gas outflows, measured by the velocity dispersion and velocity shift of the \OIII\ emission line, clearly shows a correlation with SFR.
    - Compared to star-forming galaxies in the main sequence, both type 1 and type 2 AGNs show sSFR similar to that of non-AGN galaxies, indicating no instantaneous AGN feedback

- [The MOSDEF Survey: Untangling the Emission-line Properties of z∼2.3 Star-forming Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04924)

    - Star-forming regions in the more offset galaxies are characterized by harder ionizing spectra at fixed nebular oxygen abundance.
    - "High" sample size更小，质量更低，has higher specific star-formation rate and star-formation-rate surface density values and is slightly younger compared to the "low" population.

    - 用总卫星星系光度看SDSS中的AGN的halo质量: Both optically-selected and WISE-selected AGN have L_sat values twice as high as non-active galaxy samples when controlling for stellar mass and mean stellar age. 意味着halo质量更大
    - When only controlling for host galaxy stellar mass, WISE-selected AGN also have higher L_sat values than optical AGN at the factor of two level, consistent with previous results comparing the clustering of obscured and unobscured AGN.
    - Although AGN luminosity correlates with mean stellar age, the difference in stellar age between the WISE and optical samples cannot be fully explained by differences in their AGN luminosity distributions.

- [Fate of stellar bars in minor merger of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04942)
    - We demonstrate that the central stellar bar, initially present in the host galaxy, undergoes a transient bar amplification phase after each pericentre passage of the satellite
    - Once the merger happens, the central stellar bar weakens substantially, followed by a complete destruction of the bar in merger remnant for some models. 并合进来的星系增加了中心区域的恒星质量和角动量，导致了棒结构的削弱。
    - This demonstrates that minor merger of galaxies is a plausible avenue for bar weakening/destruction in disc galaxies.

- [The ubiquity of AGN winds in Seyfert 1 galaxies at low redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04976)
    - In 37% of the Sy1s the outflows appear as broad, blue-shifted, of the [OIII]5007, with a mean maximum velocity V_max ~1014 km/s$, consistent with AGN winds.
    - 分成有宽Balmer线的和只有窄Balmer线的，以及有没有wind的
    - 1. the BH mass is systematically higher and the power-law steeper in the Sy1B-Sy1Bw than in the Sy1N-Sy1Nw
    - 2. V_max is higher in the Sy1Bw than in the Sy1Nw, correlated in both groups with the BH mass and bolometric luminosity
    - 3. the Eddington ratio and SFR are higher in the Sy1 with outflows
    - 4. the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of the Sy1s are normal for their morphology and mass; typical of early-type spiral galaxies in the green valley, far from the quenched regime

- [The NIBLES bivariate luminosity--HI mass distribution function revised using Arecibo follow-up observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05077)
    - Our total follow-up sample consists of 234 galaxies, and it spans the entire luminosity and color range of the parent NIBLES sample of 2600 nearby (900 < cz< 12,000 kms−1) SDSS galaxies.
    - This indicates that while low HI-mass-to-light ratio galaxies do not contribute much to the one-dimensional HIMF, their inclusion has a significant impact on the densities in the two-dimensional distribution.

    - We also find that galaxies at higher halo mass (at constant stellar mass) have younger lookback times, possibly due to a larger reservoir of gas for star formation.
    - An exception to this is a sub sample with high stellar-to-halo mass ratios, which are likely massive, field spirals.
    - 观测和模拟符合得不错，只是具体的assembly time不同，可能是AGN feedback的影响

- [The Star-Formation Properties of the Observed and Simulated AGN Universe: BAT vs EAGLE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05115)
    - After correcting for the known +0.2 dex offset in the SFRs between EAGLE and previous observations, we find agreement in the SFR and X-ray luminosity distributions; however we find that the stellar masses in EAGLE are 0.2−0.4 dex greater than the observational sample, which consequently leads to lower sSFRs.
    - We also use EAGLE to select a sample of AGN host galaxies at high and low redshift and follow their characteristic evolution from z=8 to z=0. We find similar behaviour between these two samples, whereby star formation is quenched when the black hole goes through its phase of most rapid growth.

- [Orbital distribution of infalling satellite halos across cosmic time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05710)
    - we quantify the orbital distribution of subhalos at infall time and its mass and redshift dependence in a large dynamic range 并提供一个可以用于SAM的模型
    - 掉入时的速度分布是universal的，峰值在host的virial速度上；下落轨道在速度接近维里速度时是radially biased的
    - Subhalos that have a higher host mass or a higher sub-to-host ratio tend to move along a more radial direction with a relatively smaller angular momentum than their low host mass or low sub-to-host ratio counterparts
    - The above trends are consistent with the scenario where the dynamical environment is relatively colder for more massive structures because their own gravity is more likely to dominate the local potentials.

- [Perturbation theory for modeling galaxy bias: validation with simulations of the Dark Energy Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05991)
    - **Relevant**
    - We find that an effective PT model with five galaxy bias parameters provides a good description of the 3D correlation functions above scales of 4 Mpc/h and z<1.
    - We also measure the relationship between the non-linear and linear bias parameters and compare them to their expected co-evolution values.

- [Pre-processing, group accretion and the orbital trajectories of associated subhaloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05475)
    - 基于高分辨N-body模拟：We find that roughly 21 per cent of subhaloes within a host's virial radius are currently on first infall, and have not yet reached their first orbital pericentre; roughly 44 per cent are still approaching their first apocentre after infall.
    - 半数的被吸积的系统经历了pre-processed，20%是以在星系群中被一起吸积
    - We confirm that the entire population of accreted subhaloes - often referred to as "associated" subhaloes -- extend far beyond the virial radii of their hosts, with roughly half currently residing at distances that exceed ≈1.2×r200
    - Many of these backsplash haloes have gained orbital energy since infall, and occupy extreme orbits that carry them well past their initial turnaround radii.
    - Within 2 virial radii from host centres, the concentrations of first-infall halos are remarkably similar those of isolated field halos, whereas backsplash haloes, as well as systems that were pre-processed, are considerably more concentrated.

    - We study satellite galaxy populations as a function of host stellar mass 9.5< log(M∗/M⊙)<10.5 and redshifts 0.1< z<0.8 in the COSMOS survey
    - We find that the satellite populations of low-mass host galaxies, which we measure down to satellite masses equivalent to the Fornax dwarf spheroidal satellite of the Milky Way, remain mostly unchanged through time.
    - We test the constraining power of our measured cumulative luminosity function to calculate the low-mass end slope of the M∗−Mhalo relation. These new satellite luminosity function measurements are consistent with ΛCDM predictions

- [The Kinematics and Dark Matter Fractions of TNG50 Galaxies at z=2 from an Observational Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05486)
    - 用TNG50模拟高红移SFG观测，主要是和Genzel et al. (2020)的观测结果比较：The simulated galaxies show clear signs of disc rotation but mostly exhibit more asymmetric rotation curves, partly due to large intrinsic radial and vertical velocity components.
    - From dynamical modelling we infer rotation speeds and velocity dispersions that are in the ballpark of observational results. We find low central dark matter fractions compatible with observations (fvDM(<Re)=v2DM(Re)/v2circ(Re)∼0.29±0.11)
    - 但是盘的有效半径太小了：at fixed Re the TNG50 dark matter fractions are too high by factors of 1.5−5.

- [On the Evolution of the Globular Cluster System in NGC 1052-DF2: Dynamical Friction, Globular-Globular Interactions and Galactic Tides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05490)
    - As the velocity dispersion among the GCs is comparable to the expected internal dispersions of the individual GCs, the galaxy might be highly conducive to GC-GC merging. 也许可以解释奇怪的GCLF
    - 进行了新的模拟：Somewhat surprisingly, we infer a low merger rate of ∼0.03 Gyr−1. The main reason is that the GCs are too dense for tidal shock capture, caused by impulsive encounters among them, to operate efficiently (we infer a tidal capture rate of only ∼0.002 Gyr−1).
    - The low merger rate inferred here makes it unlikely that the unusually large luminosities of the GCs can be explained as a result of past GC-GC mergers.
    - We predict that it is improbable for the GCs to reveal tidal features, something that can be tested with future deep observations.

- [The Palomar Transient Factory Core-Collapse Supernova Host-Galaxy Sample. I. Host-Galaxy Distribution Functions and Environment-Dependence of CCSNe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05988)
    - This sample includes 888 SNe of 12 distinct classes out to redshift z≈1
    - The galaxy mass functions of Type Ic, Ib, IIb, II, and IIn SNe ranges from 105 to 1011.5 M⊙, probing the entire mass range of star-forming galaxies down to the least-massive star-forming galaxies known.
    - The galaxy mass distributions are consistent with models of star-formation-weighted mass functions. Regular CCSNe are hence direct tracers of star formation
    - Type Ib/c SNe prefer galaxies with slightly higher masses (i.e., higher metallicities) and star-formation rates than Type IIb and II SNe
    - H-poor SLSNe and SNe~Ic-BL are scarce in galaxies above 1010 M⊙. Their progenitors require environments with metallicities of <0.4 and <1 solar 年轻星族年龄，低金属丰度对SLSNe很重要

- [Effects of environment on stellar metallicity profiles of late-type galaxies in the CALIFA survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06012)
    - We find significant differences between group and field late-type galaxies in terms of their metallicity, in the sense that group galaxies are systematically more metallic than their field counterparts.
    - We find that field galaxies have, in general, metallicity profiles that show a negative gradient in their inner regions, and a shallower profile at larger radii. This contrasts with the metallicity profiles of galaxies in groups, which tend to be flat in the inner regions, and to have a negative gradient in the outer parts.

    - There is tentative evidence that Seyferts tend to show more polarized structures than starburst galaxies at the resolution of our observations.
    - We find that unlike a sample of Seyfert galaxies hosting kilo-parsec scale radio (KSR) emission, starburst galaxies with superwinds do not show radio-excess compared to the radio-FIR correlation. This suggests that shock acceleration is not adequate to explain the excess radio emission seen in Seyferts and hence most likely have a jet-related origin.
    - We find that the power contribution of AGN jet, AGN accretion, and star formation is more or less comparable in our sample of Seyfert galaxies.

    - 2% precision has been achieved with 7 Time-Delay Cosmography (TDCOSMO) lenses
    - However, without assumptions on the radial mass density profile -- and relying exclusively on stellar kinematics to break the mass-sheet degeneracy - the precision drops to 8\% with the current data of the 7 TDCOSMO lenses
    - 基于Birrer+2020，讨论在不假设mass profile的情况下考虑mass-sheet简并
    - With existing samples and technology, 3.3\% precision on H0 can be reached by adding spatially resolved kinematics of the 7 TDCOSMO lenses. The precision improves to 2.5\% with the further addition of kinematics for 50 non-time-delay lenses from SLACS and the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S).
    - Expanding the samples to 40 time delay and 200 non-time delay lenses will improve the precision to 1.5\% and 1.2\%, respectively.

    - HST八年的观测：Our final results for the PMs are (μW,μN)N147=(−0.0232,0.0378)±(0.0143,0.0146)masyr−1 for NGC 147, and (μW,μN)N185=(−0.0242,0.0058)±(0.0141,0.0147)masyr−1 for NGC 185.
    - The 2-dimensional direction of motion for NGC 147 about M31 is found to be aligned with its tidal tails
    - Our PMs show that the orbital poles of NGC 147, and also NGC 185 albeit to a lesser degree, agree within the uncertainties with the normal of the Great Plane of Andromeda (GPoA).
    - Our results strengthen the hypothesis that the GPoA may be a dynamically coherent entity

- [First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) II: The Photometric Properties of High-Redshift Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06057)
    - FLARES predicts a significantly larger number of intrinsically bright galaxies, which can be explained through a simple model linking dust-attenuation to the metal content of the interstellar medium, using a line-of-sight (LOS) extinction model
    - We show that the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) matches the observations at all redshifts. The function is fit by Schechter and double power-law forms, with the latter being favoured at these redshifts by the FLARES
    - The impact of environment on the UV LF is also explored, with the brightest galaxies forming in the densest environments.

- [Optically-Thin Spatially-Resolved Mg II Emission Maps the Escape of Ionizing Photons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06059)
    - KCWI观测：the resonant Mg II 2800 doublet from a redshift 0.36 galaxy, J1503+3644, with a previously observed escape fraction of 6%.
    - The Mg II emission has a similar spatial extent as the stellar continuum, and each of the Mg II doublet lines are well-fit by single Gaussians.
    - The Mg II is optically thin. The intrinsic flux ratio of the red and blue Mg II emission line doublet, R=F2796/F2803, is set by atomic physics to be two, but Mg+ gas along the line of sight decreases R proportional to the Mg II optical depth. Combined with the metallicity, R estimates the neutral gas column density.
    - The observed R ranges across the galaxy from 0.8-2.7, implying a factor of 2 spatial variation of the relative escape fraction. All of the ionizing photons that escape J1503+3644 pass through regions of high R.

The resulting luminosity function of the Bootes I galaxy has a 50% completeness limit of 27.4 in F814W and 28.2 in F606W (Vega magnitude system), which corresponds to a limiting stellar mass of ≤0.3M⊙

- [Biasing relation, environmental dependencies and estimation of the growth rate from line emission galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06541)
    - 用SAM研究SFR和DM的关系，search for environmental dependencies and assess their impact on the Speed-from-Light Method (SfLM) to measure the growth rate, f from luminosity/SFR shifts.
    - Quiescent galaxies are more clustered relative to the DM than the star forming ones from z=1 to the present epoch
    - The linear bias factor, b, defined as the clustering ratio of galaxies to DM, is roughly a scale-independent, constant function of the SFR for star forming galaxies.
    - For the majority of the models the SFR probability distribution is skewed to larger values in denser regions.

- [Forecasting Cosmological Constraints from the Weak Lensing Magnification of Type Ia Supernovae Measured by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06804)
    - **Interesting**
    - We present a methodology for reconstructing the probability distribution of the weak lensing magnification μ of SNe Ia, p(μ), from observational data, and using it to constrain cosmological parameters.
    - 放大率分布可以用一个stretched Gaussian分布来描述，can be used to measure the variance of μ, ξμ
    - The combination of SN Ia weak lensing magnification and distance measurements result in a ∼ 10% measurement on σ8.

- [Validating a minimal galaxy bias method for cosmological parameter inference using HSC-SDSS mock catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06873)
    - We assess the performance of a perturbation theory inspired method for inferring cosmological parameters from the joint measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing (ΔΣ) and the projected galaxy clustering (wp).
    - As long as the appropriate scale cuts, 12 and 8 h−1Mpc for ΔΣ and wp respectively, are adopted, a "minimal-bias" model using the linear bias parameter b1 alone and the nonlinear matter power spectrum can recover the true cosmological parameters (here focused on Ωm and σ8) to within the 68% credible interval
    - This is as expected if physical processes inherent in galaxy formation/evolution are confined to local, small scales below the scale cut, and thus implies that real-space observables have an advantage in filtering out the impact of small-scale nonlinear effects in parameter estimation, compared to their Fourier-space counterparts.

- [Photometric classification of HSC transients using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06726)

    - Our classifier scores an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 for binary classification (SN Ia or non-SN Ia) and 95.3% accuracy for three-class classification (SN Ia, SN Ibc, or SN II).

- [The Star-Forming Main Sequence and the contribution of dust-obscured star formation over the last 12 Gyrs from the FUV+IR luminosity functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06514)
    - **Important**
    - At any redshift, we find that the specific SFR−M∗ relation for MS SFGs approaches to a power law at the high-mass end. At lower masses it bends and eventually the slope sign changes from negative to positive at very low masses.
    - The slope sign change is related to the knee of the FUV LF.
    - We predict that the assembly time of nearby dwarf galaxies is ∼10 Gyrs consistent with their oldest observed stellar populations.
    - Using the joint evolution of the GSMF and the FUV and IR LFs is a promising empirical approach to study the stellar mass growth and dust formation/destruction mechanisms, and ultimately to constrain galaxy formation models.

- [Tidal forces from the wake of dynamical friction: warps, lopsidedness and kinematic misalignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07177)
    - A galaxy moving through a background of dark matter particles, induces an overdensity of these particles or a wake behind it. The back reaction of this wake on the galaxy is a force field that can be decomposed into an effective deceleration (called dynamical friction) and a tidal field.
    - 用孤立且lopsided的星系IC2487为例子去看这个作用力是否能产生warps，lopsidedness等结构
    - We conclude that the proposed mechanism can generate warps, lopsidedness and misalignments observed in isolated galaxies or galaxies in loose groups.

    - The HST images reveal an isolated spiral galaxy and the combination with the GMOS-IFU flux distributions and VLA data allow us to identify a partial ring of star-forming regions surrounding the nucleus with a radius of ~ 500 pc.
    - The enhanced excitation and velocity dispersion of this bubble surrounds a 8.5 GHz radio emission structure, supporting its origin in a faint AGN that is mostly shocking the surrounding gas via a plasma ejection seen in radio at the present stage

    - Simulating the Universe with Refined Galaxy Environments (SURGE)
    - The central galaxy's star formation rate and stellar mass are not strongly affected by the presence of magnetic fields, but the galaxy is more disc-dominated and its central black hole is more massive when B>0.
    - With magnetic fields, the gas fraction and metal mass fraction in the halo are higher, the atomic hydrogen-dominated extended discs around the galaxy are more massive, the circumgalactic gas flows are slower, the densities in the inner CGM are higher, the temperatures in the outer CGM are higher, the pressure in the halo is higher, and the metals are less well-mixed throughout the halo.

    - For the age ranges of 8.3 ≤ log (age/yr) ≤ 8.9 and log (age/yr) ≥ 9.5, which have significant flux contributions from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and red giant branch (RGB) stars, respectively, the age uncertainty rises to about ±0.3 dex.

    - We find tentative (2.25σ) evidence that the cluster radio-active fraction increases with cluster richness, while the fraction of cluster galaxies that are radio-luminous does not correlate with richness.
    - 有红移相关 Clusters at higher redshift are much more likely to host a radio source of luminosity L1.4 GHz≳10^26~W~Hz−1 than are lower redshift clusters
    - For 0.7< z <1.5, we find that both the cluster and field radio-luminous galaxy fraction increases with stellar mass, regardless of environment, though at fixed stellar mass, cluster galaxies are roughly 2 times more likely to be radio-luminous than field galaxies.

- [HAWC+ Far-Infrared Observations of the Magnetic Field Geometry in M51 and NGC 891](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07897)
    - SOFIA观测： For M51, the polarization vectors generally follow the spiral pattern defined by the molecular gas distribution, the far-infrared (FIR) intensity contours, and other tracers of star formation.
    - The fractional polarization is much lower in the FIR-bright central regions than in the outer regions, and we rule out loss of grain alignment and variations in magnetic field strength as causes.
    - For NGC 891, the FIR polarization vectors within an intensity contour of 1500 MJy sr−1 are oriented very close to the plane of the galaxy. The FIR polarimetry is probably sampling the magnetic field geometry in NGC 891 much deeper into the disk than is possible with NIR polarimetry and radio synchrotron measurements.

    - The spatial scintillation pattern is highly anisotropic, with a semi-minor axis of about 20,000 km.
    - The canonical theory of refractive scintillation constrains the scattering plasma to be within the Oort cloud. The sightline to J1402+5347, however, passes unusually close to the B3 star Alkaid (eta UMa) at a distance of 32 pc

- [NGC 2770: high supernova rate due to interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08091)
    - NGC 2770 was dubbed a SN factory, because it hosted four core-collapse SNe in 20 years
    - Its star formation rate (SFR) was reported not to be enhanced and therefore not compatible with such a high SN rate.
    - 作者认为主要是SFR indicator的问题，尘埃改正后的Halpha SFR符合SN rate，说明和时标有关：Hence, the unique feature of NGC 2770 compared to other galaxies is the fact that it is observed very recently after the enhancement of the SFR
    - SFR的升高可能是和近邻星系的频繁相互作用造成的
    - There are no clear HI concentrations close to the positions of SNe in NGC 2770 such as those detected for hosts of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and broad-lined SNe type Ic (IcBL). This suggests that the progenitors of type Ib SNe are not born out of recently accreted atomic gas, as was suggested for GRB and IcBL SN progenitors.

    - At 100 GHz, we measure non-zero power at 97.8% and 99.9% confidence in the ACA and ALMA data sets, respectively.
    - Using line ratios appropriate for high-redshift galaxies, we find these results to be in good agreement with those from the CO Power Spectrum Survey (COPSS). Adopting αCO=3.6 M⊙ (K km s−1 pc2)−1, we estimate a cosmic molecular gas density of ρH2(z)∼10^8 M⊙ Mpc−3 between z=1−3.

    - 模拟研究：The most massive star has a stellar mass of over 6000 M⊙. However, accretion onto all stars declines significantly after the first ∼ 100 kyr of evolution as the surrounding material is accreted and the turbulent nature of the gas causes the stars to move to lower density regions
    - As the massive stars end their lives as direct collapse black holes this will seed these embryonic haloes with a population of black holes with masses between approximately 300 M⊙ and 10,000 M⊙.

    - This is a very peculiar system with strong C I absorption seen associated with a neutral hydrogen column density of log N(H I) (cm−2) = 18.10, too small to shield the gas from any external UV flux.
    - Carbon is overabundant relative to iron, [C/Fe] > +2.2 at [Fe/H] ∼ −1.6. Such a metal abundance pattern is reminiscent of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars detected in the Galaxy halo

- [The LOFAR view of FR0 radio galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08099)
    - This sample includes 104 compact radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) associated with nearby (z<0.05) massive early-type galaxies
    - 12 FR0s present resolved emission of low surface brightness which contributes between 5% and 40% of the total radio power at 150 MHz, usually with a jetted morphology extending between 15 and 50 kpc.
    - The fraction of FR0s showing evidence for the presence of jets, by including both spectral and morphological information, is at least ~40%. This study confirms that FR0s and FRIs can be interpreted as two extremes of a continuous population of jetted sources, with the FR0s representing the low end in size and radio power.

    - The integrated kSZ signal displays a significant correlation with the angular momentum of the intra-halo gas, particularly for massive haloes

    - We conclude S8 is a relatively young supernova remnant (≃2700−4400 yr) exhibiting properties remarkably like those seen in the young LMC remnant N49

- [The time-scales probed by star formation rate indicators for realistic, bursty star formation histories from the FIRE simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08582)
    - We use star formation histories (SFHs) extracted from cosmological simulations of star-forming galaxies from the FIRE project to analyze the time-scales to which the Hα and far-ultraviolet (FUV) continuum SFR indicators are sensitive.
    - When FIRE SFHs are partitioned into their bursty and time-steady phases, the best-fitting FUV time-scale fluctuates from its ~10 Myr value when the SFR is time-steady to >~100 Myr immediately following particularly extreme bursts of star formation during the bursty phase. On the other hand, the best-fitting averaging time-scale for Hα is generally insensitive to the SFR variability in the FIRE simulations and remains ~5 Myr at all times.
    - 比文献中常假设的100 Myr和10 Myr时标要短
    - Our results confirm that the ratio of SFRs inferred using Hα vs. FUV can be used to probe the burstiness of star formation in galaxies.

The sample can be used to investigate the non-linear relation between the UV and X-ray luminosity of quasars, and to build a Hubble diagram up to redshift z~7.5.
    - (i) the X-ray to UV relation provides distance estimates matching those from supernovae up to z~1.5, and (ii) its slope shows no redshift evolution up to z~5.

    - We find broad Fe Kα line emission in the average COSMOS spectrum (Gaussian width σ=0.27±0.05 keV), and by fitting this emission line profile with relativistic line models, we measure the average black hole spin parameter a=0.62 +0.07−0.17.

    - Doubly-ionized neon ([NeIII]λ3869) is detected at ≥3σ in 61 galaxies, representing ∼25% of the sample of MOSDEF galaxies with Hα, Hβ, and [OIII]λ5007 detections at similar redshifts.
    - We find that the [NeIII]λ3869/[OII]λ3727 ratio (Ne3O2) is anti-correlated with stellar mass, as expected based on the mass-metallicity relation. We also find that Ne3O2 is positively correlated with the [OIII]λ5007/[OII]λ3727 ratio (O32) in z∼2 galaxies, but that z∼2 line ratios are offset towards higher Ne3O2 at fixed O32
    - The nebular emission-line ratios of z∼2 star-forming galaxies suggest a harder ionizing spectrum (lower stellar metallicity, i.e., Fe/H) at fixed gas-phase oxygen abundance, compared to systems at z∼0.
    - These new results based on neon lend support to the physical picture painted by oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur emission, of an ionized ISM in high-redshift star-forming galaxies irradiated by chemically young, α-enhanced massive stars.

    - We compared the number of known dwarf galaxy candidates around NGC24, NGC45, and five other well-studied low-mass giant galaxies (NGC 1156, NGC2403, NGC5023, M33, and the LMC) with predictions from cosmological simulations and found that for the stellar-to-halo mass models considered, the observed satellite numbers tend to be on the lower end of the expected range.

- [Mock catalogs for the extragalactic X-ray sky: simulating AGN surveys with Athena and with the AXIS probe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09133)
    - We use our mocks to perform a set of end-to-end simulations of X-ray surveys with the forthcoming Athena mission and with the AXIS probe, a sub-arcsecond resolution X-ray mission concept
    - In a total observing time of 15Ms, AXIS would detect ~225,000 AGNs and ~50,000 non-active galaxies, reaching a flux limit f_0.5-2~5E-19 erg/s/cm2 in the 0.5-2 keV band, with an improvement of over an order of magnitude with respect to surveys with current X-ray facilities.

- [High-redshift galaxy groups as seen by Athena/WFI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09271)
    - 高红移处的第一代星系群：Baryonic physics, like stellar and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in this very active epoch, are expected to have left a strong imprint on the thermo-dynamic properties of these early galaxy groups.
    - 模拟Atehna数据：In the deep Wide Field Imager (WFI) survey expected to be carried out during part of Athena's first four years (the nominal mission lifetime) more than 10,000 galaxy groups and clusters at z≥0.5 will be discovered
    - We find that Athena can detect ∼20 high-redshift galaxy groups with masses of M500≥ 5×1013 M⊙ and z≥2, and almost half of them will have a gas temperature determined to a precision of ΔT/T≤25%.

- [Interaction of a cold cloud with a hot wind: the regimes of cloud growth and destruction and the impact of magnetic fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09118)
    - 冷热气体的相互作用：
        - A sufficiently small cold cloud is destroyed by the hot wind as a result of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, which shatter the cloud into small pieces that eventually mix and dissolve in the hot wind. 小质量的团块因为K-H不稳定性被摧毁
        - On the contrary, stripped cold gas from a large cloud mixes with the hot wind to intermediate temperatures, and then becomes thermally unstable and cools, causing a net accretion of hot gas to the cold tail. 冷气体与热气体混合导致热不稳定性，进而冷却
    - 用AREPO探索destruction与growth的边界：We find that the hot-wind cooling time sets the transition radius and not the cooling time of the mixed phase. Magnetic fields modify the wind-cloud interaction.
    - We furthermore predict jellyfish galaxies to have ordered magnetic fields aligned with their tails.

- [Gas accretion regulates the scatter of the mass-metallicity relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09127)
    - GAEA模型：the cold gas content (whose largest fraction is represented by the atomic gas phase) can be considered as the third parameter governing the scatter of the predicted mass-metallicity relation
    - The trends can be explained with fluctuations of the gas accretion rates:
        - A decrease of the gas supply leads to an increase of the gas metallicity due to star formation, 解释了offsets above the mass-metallicity relation
        - An increase of the available cold gas leads to a metallicity depletion. --> Offset below the mass-metallicity relation
        - In low and intermediate mass galaxies, these negative offsets are primarily determined by late gas cooling dominated by material that has been previously ejected due to stellar feedback.

- [Revisiting the Gas Kinematics in SSA22 Lyman-α Blob 1 with Radiative Transfer Modeling in a Multiphase, Clumpy Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09130)
    - KCWI+MOSFIRE观测：KCWI重构Lya窄带图像，找到一些特征
    - By fitting a set of multiphase, ‘clumpy’ models to the observed Lyα profiles, we are able to reasonably constrain many parameters, namely the H I number density in the inter-clump medium (ICM), the cloud volume filling factor, the random velocity and outflow velocity of the clumps, the H I outflow velocity of the ICM and the local systemic redshift.
    - 结论：
        - The observed Lyα spectra require relatively few clumps per line-of-sight as they have significant fluxes at the line center;
        - The velocity dispersion of the clumps yields a significant broadening of the spectra
        - The clump bulk outflow can also cause additional broadening if the H I in the ICM is optically thick
        - The H I in the ICM is responsible for the absorption feature close to the Lyα line cente

- [The distribution and properties of DLAs at z ≤ 2 in the EAGLE simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09302)
    - 基于EAGLE模拟：
        - We find that the covering fraction of DLAs increases at higher redshift;
        - A significant fraction of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) resides in the outskirts of galaxies with stellar mass greater than or equal to 1010 M⊙;
        - The covering fraction of DLAs in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is enhanced relative to that of the interstellar medium (ISM) with increasing halo mass.
    - Moreover, we find that the mean density of the HI in galaxies increases with increasing stellar mass, while the DLAs in high- and low-halo-mass systems have higher column densities than those in galaxies with intermediate halo masses (~ 10^12 M⊙ at z = 0).

- [Measuring the stellar population parameters of the early-type galaxy NGC 3923 -- The challenging measurement of the initial mass function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09557)
    - **Relevant**
    - IMACS观测：NGC 3923 at optical (3700-6600 Angstrom), and near-infrared (7900-8500 Angstrom) wavelengths
    - 考虑了各种情况：1) We compare two different stellar population model libraries; 2) we undertake spectral index fitting as well as full spectral fitting; 3) we have performed simulations for which we a priori know the input IMF, and which closely match our data; 4) we also investigate the effects of including a two-component, rather than a single stellar population.
    - We find some indication (although assumption-dependent) for a bottom-heavy IMF in the mass-range 0.5-1.0 M_sun, while the IMF in the mass-range 0.08-0.5 M_sun appears to be Milky-Way like and constant. Including near-infrared data to our analysis gives consistent results, and improves the precision.

- [Clustering in the Simulated Hα Galaxy Redshift Survey from Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09746)
    - 基于Galacticus SAM模拟1 < z < 2的Halpha星系：we investigate the expected precision and accuracy of the BAO and RSD measurements using the same analysis techniques used in analyzing real data.
    - We find that the Roman Hα galaxy survey alone can measure the angular diameter distance with 2% uncertainty, the Hubble parameter with 3-6% uncertainty, and the linear growth parameter with 7% uncertainty

- [No redshift evolution of non-repeating fast radio-burst rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09746)
    - The time-integrated-luminosity functions of non-repeating FRBs do not show any significant redshift evolution. The volumetric occurrence rates are almost constant during the past ∼10 Gyr.
    - The nearly-constant rate is consistent with a flat trend of cosmic stellar-mass density traced by old stellar populations
    - In contrast, the occurrence rates of repeating FRBs may increase towards higher redshifts in a similar way to the cosmic star formation-rate density or black hole accretion-rate density if the slope of their luminosity function does not evolve with redshift

- [A giant radio bridge connecting two clusters in Abell 1758](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09613)
    - We used deep radio observations from 53 MHz to 1.5 GHz to study the pre-merging galaxy clusters A1758N and A1758S that are ∼2 Mpc apart. We confirm the presence of a giant bridge of radio emission connecting the two systems
    - The bridge is clearly visible in the LOFAR image at 144 MHz and tentatively detected at 53 MHz.

- [Compact galaxies and the size-mass galaxy distribution from a colour-selected sample at 0.04 < z < 0.15 supplemented by ugrizYJHK photometric redshifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09625)
    - **Relevant**
    - Massive compact星系：a sample was selected from the 9-band combination of SDSS and UKIDSS photometry to r < 17.8.
    - Following Barro et al., log S_1.5 = log M_* - 1.5 log r_50 was used in order assess the completeness and number density of massive compact galaxies (log M_* > 10, log S_1.5 > 10.5). The spectroscopic completeness was 76% for compact galaxies compared to 92% for normal-size galaxies.
    - Using environmental overdensities, this confirms that compact quiescent galaxies are significantly more likely to be found in high-density environments compared to normal-size galaxies.
    - The number density of compact quiescent galaxies drops by a factor of about 30 from z ~ 2 to log (n / Mpc^-3) = -5.3 +- 0.4 in the SDSS-UKIDSS sample.

- [GHOST: Using Only Host Galaxy Information to Accurately Associate and Distinguish Supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09630)
    - **Interesting**
    - Our results suggest that the hosts of SLSNe, SNe Ia, and core collapse supernovae can be separated using host brightness information and extendedness measures derived from the host's light profile.
    - We can distinguish SNe Ia and core collapse supernovae with ~70% accuracy without any photometric data from the event itself.

- [Populating HI gas in dark matter halos: I. method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09804)
    - SDSS+ALFALFA: if we solely use galaxy associated scaling relations to predict the HI gas distribution (solely component 1), the number of HI detections is significantly over-predicted with respect the ALFALFA observations.
    - We introduce a concept for the survival of the HI masses/members within halos of different masses labelled as the `efficiency' factor, in order to describe the probability that a halo has in retaining its HI detections.
    - We construct a `halo based HI mass model' which does not only predict the HI masses of galaxies, but also yields similar number, stellar, halo mass and satellite fraction distributions to the HI detections retrieved from observational data.

- [Knocking on giants' doors: I. The evolution of the dust-to-stellar mass ratio in distant dusty galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09995)
    - We find that Mdust/M⋆ evolves with redshift, stellar mass, specific SFR and integrated dust size, differently for main sequence and starburst galaxies.
    - In both galaxy populations Mdust/M⋆ rises until z∼2 followed by a roughly flat trend towards higher redshifts. We show that the inverse relation between Mdust/M⋆ and M⋆ holds up to z≈5 and can be interpreted as an evolutionary transition from early to late starburst phases.
    - We demonstrate that Mdust/M⋆ in starbursts mirrors the increase in molecular gas fraction with redshift, and is enhanced in objects with the most compact dusty star-formation.

- [Metals and Molecules in the Distant Universe: Magellan MIKE Observations of Gas-rich Galaxies at 2<z<3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10207)
    - We present abundance measurements of the elements Zn, S, O, C, Si and Fe for four sub-DLAs at redshifts ranging from z=2.173 to z=2.635

- [The distance to the giant elliptical galaxy M87 and the size of its stellar subsystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10213)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    - The position of the tip of the red-giant branch (the TRGB discontinuity) is found to vary with galactocentric distance. This variation can be interpreted as the effect of metal-rich red giants on the procedure of the measurement of the TRGB discontinuity or as a consequence of the existence of a weak gas-and-dust cloud around M87 extending out to 10′ along the galactocentric radius
    - The TRGB stars located far from the M87 center yield an average distance modulus of (m−M)=30.91±0.08, which corresponds to the distance of D=15.4±0.6 Mpc
    - It is shown that stars in the field located between M86 and M87 galaxies at angular separations of 37′ and 40′ are not intergalactic stars, but belong to the M87 galaxy, i.e., that the stellar halo of this galaxy can be clearly seen at a galactocentric distance of 190 kpc.

- [A complete search for redshift z>6.5 quasars in the VIKING survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10297)
    - We used the Bayesian model comparison (BMC) selection method of Mortlock et al., producing a ranked list of just 21 candidates.
    - The sources ranked 1, 2, 3 and 5 are the four known z>6.5 quasars in this field. Additional observations of the other 17 candidates, primarily DESI Legacy Survey photometry and ESO FORS2 spectroscopy, confirm that none is a quasar.
    - i) BMC produces eight times fewer false positives than colour cuts, while also reaching 0.3 mag. deeper, ii) the SED fitting method is extremely efficient but reaches 0.7 mag less deep than the BMC method, picking out only one of the four known quasars.

- [Lessons from the first multiply imaged supernova: A revised Light-Traces-Mass strong lensing model for the galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10641)
    - Light-trace-mass (LTM) SL建模的测试
    - Supernova Refsdal supplied an invaluable opportunity to conduct a blind test of the ability of common lens-modeling techniques to accurately describe the properties of SN Refsdal's images and predict the reappearance of one of its counter images that was due about a year post-discovery of the original Einstein cross.
    - 修正了一个之前的bug：Here we update our model and present revised LTM measurements for Refsdal.

- [Lessons from the first multiply imaged supernova II: A parametric strong-lensing model for the galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10642)
    - 基于grid的参数透镜模型，和LTM模型比较：We obtain reasonably similar (agreeing to within ≃1−3σ, in most cases) time delays and magnification ratios, with respect to S1, from the two different methods, although the LTM predictions seem to be systematically shorter/smaller for some of the images
    - Most notably, the time delay [and 95\% CI] between the Einstein cross (in particular, image S1), and SX, the image that appeared about a year after the original discovery of the cross, differs substantially between the parametric method (326 [300 -- 359] days) and the LTM method (224 [198 -- 306] days), which seems to underestimates the true reappearance time

- [Cosmography using strong lensing systems and cosmic chronometers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10655)
    - We present the equation for the angular diameter distance in the y-redshift scenario for cosmography and use it to test the cosmographic parameters. In addition, we also use the observational Hubble data from cosmic chronometers and a Joint analysis of both data is performed.

- [Efficient Mass Estimate at the Core of Strong Lensing Galaxy Clusters Using the Einstein Radius](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10676)
    - At the cores of strong lensing clusters, the Einstein radius can be turned into a mass estimate. This efficient method has been routinely used in literature, in lieu of detailed mass models; however, its scatter, assumed to be ∼30%, has not yet been quantified.
    - 用模拟进行检验: We measure a scatter of 13.9% and a positive bias of 8.8% in M(<θE), with no systematic correlation with total cluster mass, concentration, or lens or source redshifts
    - We find that increased deviation from spherical symmetry increases the scatter; conversely, where the lens produces arcs that cover a large fraction of its Einstein circle, both the scatter and the bias decrease

- [Combination of cluster number counts and two-point correlations: Validation on Mock Dark Energy Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10757)
    - **Interesting, Important**
    - Present a method of combining cluster abundances and large-scale two-point correlations, namely galaxy clustering, galaxy-cluster cross-correlations, cluster auto-correlations, and cluster lensing.
    - The posterior distribution from the analysis of simulations is statistically consistent with the absence of systematic biases detectable at the precision of the DES Y1 experiment.

- [Joint Survey Processing of Euclid, Rubin and Roman: Final Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10663)
    - **Relevant**
    - The ultimate cosmological, astrophysical and time-domain science yield from these missions will require joint survey processing (JSP) functionality at the pixel level that is outside the scope of the individual survey projects.
    - 1) provide precise concordance multi-wavelength images and catalogs over the entire sky area where these surveys overlap, which accounts for source confusion and mismatched isophotes, and 2) provide a science platform to analyze concordance images and catalogs to enable a wide range of astrophysical science goals to be formulated and addressed by the research community.

- [Chandra reveals a luminous Compton-thick QSO powering a Lyα blob in a z=4 starbursting protocluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10613)
    - We investigated the AGN content of a gas-rich and starbursting protocluster at z=4, known as the Distant Red Core (DRC).
    - We detected obscured X-ray emission from the two most gas-rich members of the DRC, named DRC-1 and DRC-2. Both of them are resolved into multiple interacting clumps in high-resolution ALMA and HST observations.
    - DRC-2 is found to host a luminous (L2−10keV≈3×1045ergs−1) Compton-thick (NH≳1024cm−2) QSO, comparable to the most luminous QSOs known at all cosmic times.
    - X-ray stacking analysis reveals that SMBH accretion is likely also taking place in other DRC galaxies that are not detected individually by Chandra.
    - The powerful and obscured QSO detected in DRC-2 is likely powering the nearby LAB detected with VLT/MUSE

- [Spectroscopic observations of the machine-learning selected anomaly catalogue from the AllWISE Sky Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10658)
    - One-class support vector machines (OCSVM) 做Anomaly detection
    - Among the observed objects, we identified three main types of sources: i) low redshift (z~0.03-0.15) galaxies containing large amounts of hot dust (53%), including three Wolf-Rayet galaxies; ii) broad-line quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) (33%) including low-ionisation broad absorption line (LoBAL) quasars and a rare QSO with strong and narrow ultraviolet iron emission; iii) Galactic objects in dusty phases of their evolution (3%).

- [Dust and star formation in the centre of NGC 3311](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10662)
    - 看Hydra I BCG中心的尘埃形成：We used the tool PyParadise to model the stellar population and extract the emission lines.
    - A dusty 'mini-jet' emanates from the centre. The distribution of the emission line gas matches the dust silhouette almost exactly.
    - Close to the brightest Halpha emission, the ratio [NII]/Halpha resembles that of HII-regions; in the outer parts, [NII] gets stronger and is similar to LINER-like spectra.
    - The presence of neutral gas is indicated by the fit residuals of the stellar NaI D absorption line, which we interpret as interstellar absorption. We estimate the mass of the neutral gas to be of the order of the X-ray mass.
    - Our findings can be harmonised in a scenario in which the star formation is triggered by the accretion of cold gas onto a pre-existing gas/dust disc or ring. Newly produced dust then contributes to the longevity of the dust.

- [Compact elliptical galaxies in different local environments: a mixture of galaxies with different origins?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10686)
    - **Relevant**
    - 把Compact elliptical分成有bright host和没有bright host的：No statistically significant difference in age distribution was found between the cE(w)s and cE(w/o)s.
    - In the mass-metallicity distribution, cE(w)s deviate from the relation observed for early-type galaxies at a given stellar mass, whereas cE(w/o)s conform to the relation.
    - cE(w)s would be the remnant cores of the massive progenitor galaxies whose outer parts are tidally stripped by a massive neighboring galaxy (i.e., nurture origin). In contrast, cE(w/o)s are likely the faint end of early-type galaxies maintaining in-situ evolution in an isolated environment with no massive galaxy nearby (i.e., nature origin)

- [The VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project: Average radio spectral energy distribution of active galactic nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10969)
    - In determining physical properties of galaxies from radio data, the radio SED is often assumed to be described by a simple power law, usually with a spectral index of 0.7 for all sources
    - Construct average radio SED: We combined VLA observations of the COSMOS field at 1.4 GHz and 3 GHz with GMRT observations at 325 MHz and 610 MHz. To account for nondetections in the GMRT maps, we employed the survival analysis technique.
    - We find that a sample of RxAGN can be described by a spectral index of α1=0.28±0.03 below the break frequency νb=(4.1±0.2) GHz and α2=1.16±0.04 above, while a simple power-law model yields a single spectral index of α=0.64±0.07.

- [A study of extragalactic planetary nebulae populations basedon spectroscopy. I. Data compilation and first findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11097)
    - 500 PNe in 13 galaxies: We find that the ionized masses and the luminosities in Hβ, LHβ, of around 30 objects previously identified as PNe indicate that they are most likely compact HII regions.
    - We find an anticorrelation between the electron densities and the ionized masses in M31, M33, and NGC 300 which suggests that most of the PNe observed in these galaxies are probably ionization bounded. This trend is absent in LMC and SMC suggesting that many of their PNe are density bounded.
    - We also find that the brightest PNe in the sample are not necessarily the youngest since there is no correlation between electron densities and the Hβ luminosities
    - The strong correlation found between LHβ-L[OIII] implies that the so far not understood cut off of the planetary luminosity function (PNLF) based on [O III] magnitudes can be investigated using LHβ, a parameter much easier to study.

    - We have performed a detailed multi-wavelength analysis of the core of XDCPJ0044.0-2033 (XDCP0044), one of the most massive and densest galaxy clusters currently known at redshift z~1.6
    - In the central region of the cluster (~70x70 kpc^2), 2 systems of interacting galaxies have been identified and studied (Complex A and B), with a total of 7 confirmed cluster members. These galaxies show perturbed morphologies and 3 of them show signs of AGN activity.
    - In particular, 2 type-1 AGN with typical broad lines have been found at the center of each complex (both of them X-ray obscured and highly accreting; Eddington ratio ~0.5), while a type-2 AGN has been discovered in Complex A.
    - The 3 AGN provide one of the closest AGN triple at z>1 revealed so far with a minimum(maximum) projected distance of ~10(40) kpc.

    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    - Given that UDGs formed through environmental processes are more likely to be accreted at high redshift, these systems have more GCs than non-UDGs.
    - Among our model objects, both UDGs and non-UDGs present a correlation between halo mass and GC mass, although UDGs have lower dynamical masses at a given GC mass.
    - Because of the effectiveness of GC disruption, we predict that GCs around UDGs should have a more top heavy mass function than GCs around non-UDGs.

    - **Interesting**
    - 超高分辨率的数值模拟：We find that the simulated dwarfs and ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) reproduce the observed structural and dynamical properties of galaxies with −3<MV<−19
    - We predict the vast majority of nearby galaxies will be observable given the surface brightness limits of the Vera Rubin Observatory's co-added Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).
    - We additionally show that faint dwarfs with velocity dispersions ≲5 km/s result from severe tidal stripping of the host halo.
        - We find that the majority of the UFDs are quenched prior to interactions with the Milky Way, though some of the quenched UFDs retain their gas until infall.

- [Completing the Census of AGN in GOODS-S/HUDF: New Ultra-Deep Radio Imaging and Predictions for JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11208)
    - We identify AGN within faint radio populations at cosmic noon selected from new ultra-deep, high resolution imaging from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 6 and 3 GHz
    - We uncover AGN in fully half our faint radio sample, indicating a source density of one AGN arcmin−2, with a similar number of radio-undetected AGN identified via X-ray over the same area
    - 大部分有射电探测的AGN都是radio-quiet的，SF就可以解释射电辐射
    - We find AGN radio signatures in our sample: ∼12% with radio excess indicating radio-loud activity and ∼16% of radio-quiet AGN candidates with flat or inverted radio spectra. The latter is a lower limit, pending our upcoming deeper 3 GHz survey.

- [A Catalog of 406 AGNs in MaNGA: A Connection between Radio-mode AGN and Star Formation Quenching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11210)
    - We identify the AGNs via mid-infrared WISE colors, Swift/BAT ultra hard X-ray detections, NVSS and FIRST radio observations, and broad emission lines in SDSS spectra
    - we find that the radio-mode AGN host galaxies reside preferentially in elliptical galaxies, lie further beneath the star-forming main sequence (with lower star formation rates at fixed galaxy mass), have older stellar populations, and have more negative stellar age gradients with galactocentric distance (indicating inside-out quenching of star formation).

- [Host Galaxy Properties of Changing-look AGN Revealed in the MaNGA Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11336)
    - All MaNGA CL-AGNs reside in the star-forming main sequence, similar to MaNGA non-changing-look AGNs (NCL-AGNs). The 80%±16% of our CL-AGNs do possess pseudo-bulge features, and follow the overall NCL-AGNs MBH−σ∗ relationship.
    - MaNGA CL-AGNs however show a higher, but not statistically significant (20%±16%) fraction of counter-rotating features compared to that (1.84%±0.61%) in general star-formation population.

    - The discovery of two remarkable high-opacity HI 21cm absorbers against low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs), at z=1.2166 towards J0229+0044 and at z=1.1630 towards J0229+0053.
    - The velocity-integrated HI 21cm optical depths are (74.2±7.8) km s−1 (J0229+0044) and (78.41±0.81) km s−1 (J0229+0053), higher than that of any known redshifted HI 21cm absorber at z>0.12, and implying high H{\sc i} column densities, >10^22 cm−2.
    - The paucity of HI 21cm absorbers at z≳1 may be due to a luminosity bias in high-z AGN samples that have been searched for HI 21cm absorption, where the high AGN ultraviolet luminosity affects physical conditions in its environment, ionizing the neutral hydrogen.

    - 用DES去看advACT挑选的SZ-cluster的Splashback半径：The splashback radius for the complete galaxy sample is consistent with theoretical measurements from CDM-only simulations, and is located at 2.4+0.3−0.4 Mpc h−1
    - 不同颜色的星系给出的profile非常不一样：Red galaxies and those in the green valley show a splashback-like minimum in their slope profile consistent with theoretical predictions, while the bluest galaxies show a weak feature that appears at a smaller radius.
    - We find that the location of the steepest slope and differences in the shapes of the profiles can be mapped to differences in the average time of infall of galaxies of different colors. 能够用Splashback位置限制星系quenching时标
    - We find that red galaxies have on average been in their clusters for over 3.2 Gyrs, green galaxies about 2.2 Gyrs, while blue galaxies have been accreted most recently and have not reached apocenter.

- [Cluster Strong Lensing with Hierarchical Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11728)
    - We aim at cluster lensing models where the parameters of all cluster-member galaxies are free to vary around some common scaling relations with non-zero scatter, and deviate significantly from them if and only if the data require it.
    - BayesLens:  We have devised a Bayesian hierarchical inference framework, which enables the determination of all lensing parameters
    - We have shown that an accurate description of cluster member galaxies is attainable, despite the large number of degrees of freedom, through fast and tractable inference.

- [The Effect of Environment on Type Ia Supernovae in the Dark Energy Survey Three-Year Cosmological Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12101)
    - 关于SNIa可能的Host环境依赖：SNe Ia in high-mass, passive hosts appear brighter than those in lower-mass, star-forming hosts.
    - We find all Hubble residual steps to be >3σ in significance, both for splitting at the traditional sample median and for the step of maximum significance.
    - We split the data into sub-samples based on SN Ia light curve parameters: stretch (x1) and colour (c), finding that redder objects (c>0) have larger Hubble residual steps, for both stellar mass and U−R, for both local and global measurements, of ∼0.14 mag.
    - Additionally, the bluer (star-forming) local environments host a more homogeneous SN Ia sample, with local U−R r.m.s. scatter as low as 0.084±0.017 mag for blue (c<0) SNe Ia in locally blue U−R environments.

- [Massive elliptical galaxies at z∼0.2 are well described by stars and a Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11724)

    - SLACS样本：lensing+动力学分析，We find that the distribution of the lensing-only logarithmic slopes has a median 2.08 ± 0.03 and intrinsic scatter 0.13 ± 0.02, consistent with the original SLACS analysis.
    - We find that the DM halos are well described by a standard Navarro–Frenk–White halo with no contraction on average for both of a constant stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) model and a stellar M/L gradient model.
    - Comparison of our inferred stellar masses with those obtained from the stellar population synthesis method supports a heavy initial mass function (IMF) such as the Salpeter IMF

- [Candidate Periodically Variable Quasars from the Dark Energy Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12329)
    - DES-SN + SDSS S82里面找QSO光变的周期性，20年的数据
    - We find five candidates with significant (at >99.74% level in at least two bands) periodicity with observed periods of ∼3--5 years (i.e., 1--2 years in rest frame) having ∼4--6 cycles spanned by the observations.
    - Our detection rate is 4--80 times larger than those found by previous searches using shallower surveys over larger areas.

- [The frequency of extreme X-ray variability of radio-quiet quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12778)
    - The tail-heavy distributions of variability amplitudes at all timescales indicate that extreme X-ray variations are driven by an additional physical mechanism and not just typical random fluctuations of the coronal emission.
    - Similarly, extreme X-ray variations of low-luminosity quasars seem to be driven by an additional physical mechanism, whereas high-luminosity quasars seem more consistent with random fluctuations.

- [Discovery of a Candidate Binary Supermassive Black Hole in a Periodic Quasar from Circumbinary Accretion Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12317)
    - we report discovery of a periodicity (P~1607 days) at 99.95% significance in the optical light curves of a quasar at z=1.53, SDSS J025214.67-002813.7W
    - The light curves are best characterized by a bursty model predicted by hydrodynamic simulations of circumbinary accretion disks. The periodicity is likely caused by accretion rate variability periodically modulated by a milli-parsec BSBH emitting gravitational waves while still being dynamically coupled to the circumbinary accretion disk.
    - Furthermore, the frequency dependence of the variability amplitudes disfavors Doppler boost as the dominant mechanism, lending independent support to the circumbinary accretion variability hypothesis

- [Clustering of red-sequence galaxies in the fourth data release ofthe Kilo-Degree Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13154)
    - The red-sequence template is built using the broad-band optical+near infrared photometry of KiDS-VIKING and the overlapping spectroscopic data sets.
    - We measure the angular two-point correlation function of the red galaxies in four redshift bins, and constrain the large scale bias of our red-sequence sample assuming a fixed ΛCDM cosmology. We find consistent linear biases for two luminosity-threshold samples (dense and luminous).

- [Ray-tracing log-normal simulation for weak gravitational lensing: application to the cross-correlation with galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13195)
    - **CSST, SSST**
    - We present an algorithm to self-consistently generate mock weak gravitational lensing convergence fields and galaxy distributions in redshift space. We generate three-dimensional cosmic density fields that follow a log-normal distribution, and ray-trace them to produce convergence maps.
    - 为HSC和PFS提供预测:We find that the nominal HSC and PFS surveys would detect the cross power spectra with signal-to-noise ratios of 20 and 5 at the lowest (z=0.7) and highest (z=2.2) redshift bins, respectively.

- [AGN jet feedback on a moving mesh: weak shocks and lobe disruption gently prevent the cooling catastrophe Martin A. Bourne, Debora Sijacki](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12784)
    - We perform very high resolution AGN jet simulations within a live, cosmologically evolved cluster with the moving mesh code AREPO.
    - During the lobe inflation phase, heating by both internal and bow shocks contributes to lobe energetics, and ~40 per cent of the feedback energy goes into the PdV work done by the expanding lobes
    - Low power jets are more likely to simply displace gas during lobe inflation, but higher power jets become more effective at driving shocks and heating the intracluster medium (ICM), although shocks rarely exceed ~2-3.
    - Lower power jet lobes are more readily disrupted and mixed with the ICM, depositing up to ~70 per cent of the injected energy, however, ultimately the equivalent of ≳50 per cent of the feedback energy ends up as potential energy of the system. 
    - Even though the mean ICM entropy is increased up to 80 Myr after the jets switch off, AGN heating is gentle, inducing no large variations in cluster radial profiles in accord with observations.

- [The SAGA Survey. II. Building a Statistical Sample of Satellite Systems around Milky Way-like Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12783)

    - 目前包括了：127 satellites around 36 MW analogs
    - We have obtained 25,372 galaxy redshifts, peaking around z=0.2. These data significantly increase spectroscopic coverage for very low-redshift objects in 17< r <20.75 around SAGA hosts
    - 银河系卫星的数量和光度可以看成是从SAGA样本里抽取出来的；大部分SAGA卫星星系都是SF的，quenched的卫星比例比LG低

    - 模拟中大部分弥散CGM是第一次下落到halo中的气体；中心区域也有准备settling into一个旋转结构的
    - The observed extended surface brightness profile is due to a combination of three components: scattering of galactic Lyman alpha emission in the CGM, in-situ emission of CGM gas (mostly infalling), and Lyman alpha emission from small satellite galaxies.

    - Hubble imaging Probe of Extreme Environments and Clusters (HiPEEC) survey
    - 6个并合星系中星团的年龄，质量，消光，和SFR估计；The recent cluster formation history and their distribution within the host galaxies suggest that systems like NGC34, NGC1614, NGC4194 are close to their final coalescing phase, while NGC3256, NGC3690, NGC6052 are at an earlier/intermediate stage.
    - Cluster mass function: 4/6个星系中1-100 Myr年龄的星团可以更好的用 an exponentially truncated power law better describes the observed mass distributions.
    - Advanced mergers have higher Mc than early/intermediate merger stage galaxies, suggesting rapid changes in the dense gas conditions during the merger.

- [The Relative Role of Bars and Environments in AGN Triggering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13100)
    - 基于SDSS的：We demonstrate that the internal process of the bar-induced gas inflow is more efficient in AGN triggering than the external mechanism of the galaxy interactions in groups and cluster outskirts.
    - We conclude that from the perspective of AGN-galaxy co-evolution, a massive black hole is one of the key drivers of spiral galaxy evolution. If it is not met, a bar instability helps the evolution, and in the absence of bars, galaxy interactions/mergers become important.
    - We also find that bars in massive galaxies are very decisive in increasing AGN fractions when the host galaxies are inside clusters.

    - We note that the environment does not seem to be the cause of the flattening of MS at high stellar masses for our sample

    - Using radial velocities and projected separations of UGCA 307, KKSG 30, and a third galaxy with an accurate distance (KKSG 29), as well as 12 other assumed companions with less accurate distances, the total mass of M 104 is estimated to be (1.55±0.49)10^13M⊙
    - Its total mass-to-luminosity ratio is MT/LK=(65±20)M⊙/L⊙, which is about three times higher than that of luminous bulgeless galaxies.
